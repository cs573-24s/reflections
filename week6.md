This week, I took a look at the flight radar visualization that shows the live air-traffic data around the world. 
Here is a link to the data: https://www.flightradar24.com/0.72,-52.48/3.

One of the coolest things about this visualization is how it combines data from different sources like ADS-B, MLAT, satellites, and radars. Plus, it throws in schedule and flight status data from airlines and airports, so you can get a sense of where each flight is coming from and where it's headed.
An aspect of this visualization is its ability to present an idea of what the global air traffic looks like, allowing users to observe the movements of aircraft across different regions simultaneously. It also gives the users the option to filter the flights by various categories such as passenger, cargo and the user can also create their own filters. We can also playback the movement of flights across a timeperiod.

An aspect of this visualization that I don't like is that it can be overwhelming to look at all the flights, and it is often hard to tell where a flight is exactly because of the crowding of them/the scale of each flight as opposed to the ground/earth.Further, some filtering particularly for cargo/passenger can be done through colors instead of removing every other flight on the page to display the filtered ones. This gives an idea of the differences in numbers of flights between the different types.

Overall, this is a very cool visualization but more can be done to improve its effectiveness and understandability.
