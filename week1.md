- I found this amazing visualization at: [observablehq/plot-choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-choropleth?intent=fork)

- The representation is about the unemployment rate by U.S. county, August 2016, gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It uses the geo mark to paint each county with a color representing the unemployment rate and renders a white mesh of the states' boundaries on top.

- The best part of the representation is that after hovering over the map, it shows the color, county, and state, which is helpful to understand each county's data.

- In the future scope, a similar kind of representation can be done to represent multiple factors across the county. Since all data is diverse, they have used a cold gradient of colors and white borders to separate each of the states and counties.

- Maps data structure is used to store the values in key-value pairs.

- I am not familiar with `json.mesh` structure, but it is used to represent the states.
