4. why interesting for me:  I personally love languages and hope to master multiple languages. Knowing which languages are widely used can help me clarify the direction of language learning, as languages are ultimately meant for practical use. Effective mastery can only be achieved through practical application, and this perspective helps us understand the prevalence, usage, and impact of many languages. Understanding the breadth of language proliferation is extremely challenging, especially if you don't travel or interact with other languages often. We know there are many languages in the world, but it's difficult to internalize how many there actually are, where they are spoken, their global prevalence, and how they influence each other. DensityDesign's "After Babylon" project, using the "World Atlas of Language Structures," has created a series of interactive maps and graphs showcasing all 2,678 languages worldwide. These visualizations display their origins, usage locations, and populations of speakers. It even illustrates relationships between them, such as language families, loanwords, and the exchange of words between languages.
