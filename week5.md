This data visualization is a web page by The DataFace. In this web page they explain and display information about the global refugee crisis during 2018. The page starts by giving the viewer context into the crisis and refugees, as well as important definitions that are recognized by the UN and used in the following data visualiztions. As a user scrolls through the web page the main section of the page is filled by visualizations, while the left hand side is used to contextualize every visualization. The first visualization is a stacked bar chart of the top countries in the world with the most total persons of concern. These bars are split and colored by type of concern. Following this are bar charts of the top 10 total refugees by country and top 10 IDPs by country. The webpage then line charts about how many refugees are allowed in by the US per year, including a stacked line hcart that splits this by region. After this is a line chart showing how many refugees are actually let into the US per year by region, as well as by religion. The page ends with sankey diagrams showing the flow of refugees from a country to where they end up, and it allows a user to search for specific countries.

I think this web page fulfills its purpose. The goal of these visualizations is to inform users and possibly inspire action. These graphs display values clearly and are able to show trends within the US as well as how it compares to other countries around the world. Some things I liked were the consistent use of colors for different types of persons of concern. I also really like how the graphs transition cleanly. One very important tool utilized was context. With every graph there is an accompanying paragraph explaining and providing context. This can be incredibly important to ensure that no information is left out, and to ensure that the designers message is getting to the users. Some critiques I have are that there is no drop down menu for the country search in the last graph, and it could be useful to include some interactivity like if you click on the refugees going to a specific country, maybe show the splits of persons of concerns for that country. Some other design critiques include using consistent fonts, in the sankey diagram the labels are a different font than the rest of the webpage, and the sankey diagram uses previously used colors which encoded the type of persons of concern, but in this diagram the color does not encode anything, which can lead to some confusion.
