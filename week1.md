Reflection:
This visualization is an interactive space to view the varying hours of daylight across the globe throughout the year. This vis allows a user to select any geography on the globe, as well as any month in the year. There is a main map with a circle select used to select the location that user would like to investigate. Following this is a chart that shows the hours of daylight for this location across the year. Accompanying this chart is a both a view of the globe at its current position and its position rotating around the sun. On the chart is a horizontal line indicating the current day of the year, and a dot indicating the current time of day. As these are adjusted by the user, the globe turns and the earth rotates around the sun corresponsing to the changes. 
I found this visualization incredibly functional and thorough. While the same could be accomplished by allowing a user to select a location, and then view a chart of the hours of daylight for that location, this visualization takes it further by showing the location's position on Earth and Earths position in its orbit. This allows a user to truly understand the complex geometries at play and how Earth's tilt and orbital position can affect daylight hours. Some design choices that I particularly liked were marking the months throughout Earth's orbit as well as on the chart. While it may be redundant I think including both helps a user comprehend the system faster as they make changes, since they don't have to look at the orbit and then look back to the chart to view what month they are looking at. I also like that the designer included the line and dot from the chart onto the render of the globe. This acts both as a way for the user to remember what location they are looking at, but also lets a user contextualize the 2d graph that they are looking at into a better visual understanding. A critique that I do have is that it is hard to know exactly where the center of the circle selector is pointing at, but I suppose that I this scale and for this visualization people won't be intereested in exact geographies and are more so interested in comparing different regions of the world throughout the year. I also think that the colors could be adjusted slightly, generally in geograpy blue is used to reference water, which it does on the globe. However blue also represents night on the chart, which after seeing the key is not an issue, but changing the blue to a darker color could help reduce any confusion, and time it takes to comprehend the graph.
