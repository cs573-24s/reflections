The time scale helps portray a day using a timeline. The percentage on the y axis shows the percent of people participating in a certain activity. Having the y scale allows you to compare the percentages for each activity each day visually by looking at the respective areas. This allows someone to immediately guess which activities take up the most time and which take up the least, as well as see the times of day where people are doing that activity the most at the peaks of the areas. The range of colors help differentiate between different activities. There are some thinner lines that make it hard to see the name of the activity unless you scroll over it. The digital format helps since scrolling over an area causes a black outline to appear around it and for a label to pop up but the black line is sort of hard to see as well. The vertical line that represents the current time as you mouse over the visual is a nice feature and it helps with comparing all the visuals at a specific time, since the areas can be a bit hard to discern when not focusing on a specific time. It also shows the breakdown from different demographics, such as age groups. It is interesting to see the visual differences between age groups, and it might be nice to have a more direct comparison between them. There are also some particular statistics that are pointed out, such as television use between different demographics, and there may be a way to convey such points about demographic comparisons more clearly. It does show its age as social media and times changing has probably impacted this a lot.
