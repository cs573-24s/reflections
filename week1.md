# Week 1 Reflection

## [Swaying the Public? Impacts of Election Forecast Visualizations on Emotion, Trust, and Intention in the 2022 U.S. Midterms](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327356)

This paper creates four different election forecasting visualizations and then analyzes the effects each visualization can have on people's emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. Here are each of the visualizations they created:

Here are the results of the study:

While I found the study itself extremely interesting, I hated how the results were visualized. I was confused by certain aspects of the graph even after reading through the results. Most specifically, the numerical scale for visualization effects should be explaned, as I don't know if the scale is meant to symbolize intensity or the spectrum of the feeling being measured. 

Additionally, it felt obvious that the reason why the Dual Quantile Dotplot scored so "low" on the surprise emotion because it is the most confusing. It is the most difficult to tell the difference between the two candidates (when compared to the other visualizations) so I think people who look at it are too busy being confused to be surprised.
