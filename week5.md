The Health Inclusivity index is a data visualization intended to represent and analyze the health landscapes of 40 countries. The term 'inclusive health' refers to the principle of ensuring all individuals, regardless of their background, identity, or socioeconomic status, have equitable access to healthcare services, resources, and information.

The visualization itself opens to a radial format view with all countries displayed. On the left-hand side, users have the option to filter and compare countries, in addition to exploring specific indicators. Users also have the option to swap the overall chart style to a bar chart format. I found this flexibility in features especially useful in facilitating data exploration since it made it easier to focus on particular countries and really delve into the breadth of information provided. Moreover, I found the scoring on the right-hand panel to be helpful in providing a quick summary of the information.

Alternatively, I do have reservations about some of the stylistic choices made in this visualization. In particular, I found the line thickness to be especially problematic. Due to the sheer number of indicators being represented for each country, the bar display was condensed to a width that not only made it hard to read but also made it a bit overwhelming to look at. Moreover, I thought the black background, though usually preferable, didn't help this issue since the black almost makes the overall visual breadth narrower and lacked adequate contrast with some graph labels (e.g., axial tick marks). In this same way, I felt a lot of the text needed to be a bit larger and thicker. The thin white text on the black background made it a little hard to track the information -- I often found myself having to lean closer to the screen to inspect a lot of details.
