## Reflection
Line charts don't always pop, but this graphic on 3rd grade-8th grade student math test scores before and after the COVID-19 pandemic caught my interest in myriad ways. For one, the color pops off the page -- I can immediately differentiate between different school districts by looking at the color corresponding to the school's label. In addition to color, time is presented uniformly and consistently -- points indicate the score for each year before and after COVID, with a line of best fit connecting each year. On the topic of time, it is immediately clear which years the COVID pandemic most affected, highlighted in yellow with an unassuming caption reading "COVID." 

Yet, where this graphic shines it also loses context: arbitrary "2 yrs. ahead" "2 yrs. behind" "3 yrs. behind" labels are used on the y-axis without a context of exactly what that means. Which metric are we comparing against? Additionally, a bold vertical line proposes the 2019 U.S. average of these same test scores (I imagine being approximately the middle year?) but not on what scale...can we assume the average indicates the point at which students are "on track" for their grade level? On the topic of grade level, 3rd grade to 8th grade is an Americanized approach -- as an international reader, I might not know which ages those grades correlate to. Additionally, should other year averages be included? I would be curious to see 2022, the first year "after" COVID according to this graph. 

Despite this, this graphic excels in its goal -- the reader can clearly see how test scores nationwide dropped in response to the COVID pandemic. I must commend the NYTimes for communicating so many details in a very clear way, and I encourage readers to plug in their home school district as the visualization contains data from 41 U.S. States!
