This is absolutely the coolest personal website I have ever seen.

The author used Three.js to simulate a CRT monitor, with color distortion, flickering, and even fingerprints on the screen, and the restoration is very, very well done.

Upon entering the simulated CRT monitor, a Win95-style system comes to life, offering a nostalgic desktop experience. Users can open a browser, explore the author's resume, and engage in various games within this virtual environment.

The website is ingeniously divided into two parts: the 3D site and the 2D OS site. The 3D site likely showcases the immersive Three.js simulation of the CRT monitor, while the 2D OS site provides a more traditional browsing experience reminiscent of the Win95 interface.

The website stands as a tribute to the golden era of computing while showcasing the author's innovative approach to web design. It's a testament to the endless possibilities that arise when technology and creativity converge, offering users a unique and memorable online experience.
