## Reflection
Since the Super Bowl was this past weekend, I found it fitting to study a visualization of where quarterbacks (QBs) tend to originate from that I found on r/dataisbeautiful. Immediately, I like the layout and color scheme -- a map of American states is fitting and Alaska and Hawaii are included. My mind first goes to "what about outside the US?" but considering the sport is American football and the NFL is an American league, I'll make the assumption that other countries are statistically insignificant.

Studying further, the colors appear to be well-defined -- I can clearly tell the difference between each, although 5 colors for 8 (max) as a scale is an interesting choice -- are numbers in between simply in between shades of those colors? They appear to be. Additionally, the given scale is based on million residents per state in the year 2000...which makes sense and is approximately halfway between 1970, when the data began, and 2024. Certain states in gray are not on the color legend, but are indicated (as in Colorado) as "No QBs." Additionally, it appears that states with the most QBs per capita are specifically noted and listed within each state -- go Iowa! From that color gradient, it's clear that southern and midwest states tend to produce the most NFL QBs.

Although data is cited at the bottom as coming from Sports Reference and the US Census, some questions remain -- what defines a state a QB originated from? The state they were born? Where they attended high school? College? The author mentions this as their birthplace as listed on Sports Reference, but this is not cited on the graph itself. Overall, I think this graph does a good job of fulfilling its purpose in a clear and concise manner (I wonder which tool this is!), and I'd love to see more visualizations from this author going forward!
