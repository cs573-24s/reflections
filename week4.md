## Reflection
At first glance, this graph of America's economic growth in the 21st century seems normal, almost mundane, but at closer look it is clear something is amiss. The y-axis, which increments by 1.0% GDP growth every other tally, goes from 5.0% to 5.5% to 6.0% at only that spot on the graphic. The reason? The one year on the chart that goes above 5.0% is 2021, the year President Biden took office, so that year's bar suddenly is twice as large (for that section of the chart) than it would be otherwise. This has the effect of overstating just how much President Biden taking office affected GDP relative to all other years presented.

Aside from the y-axis being stretched, there are other interesting design choices made -- the absense of an x-axis label makes sense, since it is clear those are years. but also the fact that the x-axis has downward facing tick marks while the y-axis does not. If the intention was to highlight GDP growth for incoming presidents, it might be valuable to highlight those years (2009, 2017, 2021) to draw attention to how much GDP grows or shrinks. The fact that the years are so low on the screen relative to most bars (to allow for negative GDP) makes sense, but also makes it hard to match year to bar -- everything blends together. Despite these comments, colors blend and complement very well and are consistent throughout the graphic, and the font choice is crisp and just large enough. Callouts for 2021 draw my immediate attention to that number, with a special mention of 5.7% GDP growth. Finally, data is well cited. 

Though immediately caught (and speculated to be a PR move to draw attention to the figure), graphics like this demonstrate how important it is to keep a watchful eye on all of the information we see in our daily lives. It's important to always be skeptical even if data is released from an official source such as the White House.
