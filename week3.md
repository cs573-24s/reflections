This infographic illustrates the changes in the nationality distribution of immigrants to the United States over the past two centuries, highlighting some interesting trends and 
transformations. The pause in immigration during World War II: From 1939 to 1945, immigration to the United States virtually came to a halt due to the effects of war and 
international turmoil. Primary source countries before World War II: As depicted in the chart, before World War II, the main source countries for immigration to the United
States included the Austro-Hungarian Empire (i.e., Austria-Hungary), Italy, and Russia, among others. Immigrants from these nations entered the United States in large numbers, 
exerting a profound influence on American culture and society. Primary source countries at the end of the 21st century: In contrast to the pre-World War II period, the main 
source countries for immigration to the United States have undergone significant changes by the end of the 21st century. Currently, the majority of immigrants come from Asia and 
South American countries. This reflects shifts in the global economic and political landscape, as well as the development of a diverse multicultural society in the United States.
