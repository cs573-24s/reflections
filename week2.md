I found a really interesting visualization called NASA/JPL's "Eyes on Asteroids", it's an interactive online app that displays real-time information and simulations about asteroids. It shows their paths, potential Earth impacts, and other key details like size and speed.
The app is designed to be both informative and educational, helping people learn more about asteroids and its composition, rotation, discovery (interactive text to the left), real-time location within the solar system, and more. It also provides information about the planets and the sun.
I think it has educational value, as it's an excellent tool for learning about asteroids, their trajectories, and potential impacts on Earth. Also the real-time data and the interactive experience are very useful.
Some potential downsides that I can see are a possible information overload, as the amount of info it provides can be overwhelming for users; and also technical requirements in terms of robust internet connections or a more advanced computer hardware to interact with the visualization.
