"World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" was designed by David McCandless and Tom Evans using VIZsweet. This visualization illustrates data breaches spanning from 2004 to 2023 in the form of interactive bubbles. The size of each bubble corresponds to the severity of the breach and contains the name of the company associated with it. Users can further inspect the bubbles by hovering over them, where they can see a short summary as well as access a link that takes them to a page with the full incident report. 

At a glance, I liked the visual impact of the various bubble sizes/colors and the interactive options that allow users to read more about the related events. In my opinion, this type of graphic is particularly useful for as an infographic for casual readers to quickly inspect the more major breaches.

This being said, there are a lot of design flaws that accompany these features. Starting with the large amount of overlap between bubbles, it's hard to identify certain incidences because they're covered by larger bubbles or squished into the perimeter of the graph. Moreover, there are also some bubbles (representative of smaller data breaches) that are difficult to see due to their small size. Alternatively, there are exceedingly large bubles that make it hard to tell when certain breaches occurred. For example, the Indonesian SIM Cards bubble spans over 3 years (2021-2023) worth of space, even though it actually ocurred in 2022. Thus, the overall organization of the chart is a bit obfuscated by the bubbles.
