This data visualization case presents a series of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to illustrate the overall situation of crime in London, including total crime, crime density, 
annual changes, and the types of crime with the highest increase in rates. It includes an overview dashboard summarizing total crime numbers, density, yearly variations, and the 
types of crime with the highest increases. A map displays the distribution of selected crime types across administrative areas. Card visual elements showcase monthly trends for 
each crime type over the past two years, total crime counts, changes from the previous year, and indicators highlighting which months saw crime rates higher than the previous year
along with the percentage change. Users can interact by using filters to change the displayed crime types on the map, clicking on administrative areas to filter card visuals, and
hovering over crime type icons and months for additional information. This design allows users, including policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and the public, to intuitively 
grasp crime situations in various London areas and obtain more detailed data through interaction, such as time trends and annual comparisons. This type of data visualization is 
highly valuable for understanding and addressing urban safety issues.
