My vizualization for this week is a map of how the US generates its electricity.
The viz offers a very comprehensive overview of the different sources of electricity, and where exactly they come from.
The use of color coding effectively delineates between different energy sources, making the map very easy to read.
The size of the cirles, however, may overestimate the scale of the prevelance of the differnet sources.
The viz employs tooltips to give more information about the sources.
This additional information includes the year the energy source location opened and its max capacity.
The viz also helps display the pressing need to transition to renewable energy sources across the country.
Not only is the map very east to read and look at, the viz is paired with an indepth analysis and instructions on how to use the tool.
The analysis greatly increases the reliabilty of the viz. 
It also offers more, smaller visualizations to further points made in the analysis.
