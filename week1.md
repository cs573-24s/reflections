The visualization that I chose for my first reflection is called " 2023 Orbital Launch Attempts - From Launch Site to Orbit ", found on r/data is beautiful.
(I was tempted to use something from r/dataisugly, but I think I will save it for next week)
The graphic shows a rocket launching from its country of orgin and it also shows where exactly the rocket launched from within each country. 
On the bottom of the graphic, there is a countetr of the total number of launches up until the date displayed, as well as the number of launces from the top 10 countries with the most launces (USA and China are far above the rest).
As the rockets launch, you can watch as they either enter one of the three levels of orbit or as they crash down back to Earth.
The data could be displayed as a bar chart showing the number of rockets at each level of orbit paired with a bar chart of the number of roket launches from each country, but instead it is a coulorful and entertaining loop that I watched probably a dozen times. 
The graphic also represents the ships in orbit at each level as white dots slowly circling the Earth. 
The graphic looks somewhat like an updated version of Space Invader (I use the term looks like very loosely), and it is extremely simple to understand with just a glance. 
I believe that a child could get the complete picture of what is displayed with no outside help, which goes to show how effective the graphic is.
