I chose this because this cool infographic showcases the beauty of 34,000 meteorites that have fallen on Earth. It's created by a UK-based designer!  The map and timeline of impacts per year are presented in clean, stylish graphics. I found interesting details like spikes in records and a comparison of the sizes of the biggest meteorites. It's not only visually appealing but also sheds light on the fascinating connection between meteorites and Earth's magnetic fields. Who knows, the future might bring more meteorites for us to explore!
