This infographic is a basic one from the site information is beautiful, which I plan to look at potentially for more visaulizations in the future.
There's a lot of information represented in this graph. First off, the two main axises, popularity and stats.
There are some clear other aspects, with the height, intelligence, and type of dog being represented in easily viewable ways.
The graph also uses transparency to effectively show multiple bits of information, with the coloring also helping.
However, I find there to be a good amount of problems with this graph.
For one, their data scoring for stats is unexplained, so you're basically taking their word for stats, which could be unmeanigful. 
The infographic or the text below doesn't post any information on how the dogs are exactly scored.
The infographic can also get really cramped and it's hard to tell what's what, especially on the top right with all the red dogs.
Although this graph does a good job displaying all the extra information, I feel this type of graph style is very constrained for making effective visualizations.
