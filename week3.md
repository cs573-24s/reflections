Unlike previous visualizations I've considered, "Journey Into Sleep" emphasizes the storytelling aspect of data visualization. Through its incorporation of art and scroll-based features, which allow viewers to explore the sleep research narrative, it resembles less of a traditional graph and more of a graphic novel. While exploring, users will encounter several data visualizations, ranging from REM stages overnight to the number of hours of sleep needed by different organisms. On their own, the data presented is rather dry and frankly uninteresting when compared to other interactive visuals (like the dashboard I reflected on last week). However, because the data is interspersed between sections with rich artistic detail and narrative, it's much more appealing to explore. 

One of the features I like the most is the quality of the supporting art. Although these are not number-based visualizations, they still serve a purpose in communicating information regarding sleep activity overall. Particularly, I found the portion with the sleeping boy that highlights different areas of his brain as users scroll to be especially interesting. I feel overall that the piece was very informative and exemplified how supporting visualizations (aside from strict data visualizations) can provide important context and better capture readers' attention. 

That being said, I do still believe there is some room for improvement with the data visualizations themselves. Personally, I think adding a few interactive features to the graphs could improve user engagement. As they are now, they're more like pictures inserted between text, which is fine; however, I found myself wishing that I could click on certain areas of the graphs to highlight them or see the data more closely. Moreover, I feel that some of the color/pattern choices (like in the economic impact bar chart) might make it difficult for some readers to see? Personally, when I see fine-line stripes on visualizations it disorients me a little.
