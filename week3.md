This visualization is similar to my first reflection, in that it applies the same techniques to fit bubbles into an area. 
This has it's own set of unique characteristics, dividing harmful chemicals and non harmful ones into different sections, and coloring them so they're obviously different.
There's also a visible color code, and it's interesting how chemicals that share multiple characteristics have zig zag lines.
This graph also uses size differentials effectively, with the size being determined by the revenue from each thing. This size differential is hard to tell for different rows however.
I also like how this infographic brings attention to specific aspects with text, making learning interesting. 
The red highlighting and the titles of the crop does a good job at contrasting, bringing attention to certain parts of the infographic.
This infographic is useful for learning about the economic and chemical aspects of crops.
It's interesting how this was made partly in d3.js, so this is a type of visualization I could also accomplish.
