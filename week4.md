I found this visualization very interesting because it really makes use of the interactivity features. Important note: The data has not been updated since 2004, so its not about the data, only about the idea being displayed. While some datasets are made interactive, but could be made static with minimal sacrificing of information, this data has far too many proper nouns to be distilled into some graph or chart. Thus, it is important that not all the data is displayed at once, and that the user is able to interact and find out things they are looking for. Additionally, statistics are kept to give people some place to start and there is an “explore” feature, so that someone who doesn’t know where to start can start somewhere. There are also a number of small features that really add to the experience of looking at the whole graph. There are information tabs for each exec and company that you can click on to find more information. If you double click on a company, the execs that don’t have any further connections will disappear and you can see which have further connections to explore. In terms of visual aspects I think this viz is really special. The aesthetic feels very ‘minimalist’ and ‘corporative’ which helps with the boardroom aspect of the dataset; the blowup animation also feels like it belongs in a corporate diagram. It also is commendable for avoiding a more provocative visualization, such as a spiderweb; the website is committed to simply portraying the data as it is. One slightly provocative yet fair addition that they make is they depict the connections of a person by the weight of their avatar - thus before even clicking on a person the viewer can have some idea about the depth of connections of an individual. I really have almost no problem with this visualization, but one thing that could potentially be done better is the use of either shading or color to depict certain distinctions; perhaps how involved a particular board member is with one company, or to show the size/presence of a company. Otherwise, this is an excellent viz that portrays publicly available information in a way that effectively communicates an important idea.
