This week's reflection I found while I was looking for interesting visualizations made in R. I came across another example of this creators work and followed the link to his website where I found this vis. The creator, Georgios Karamanis, has other interesting visualizations linked on his website. Some of the other visualizations linked on his website are more complex, and convery more information. One is highlighting data pertaining to deforestation in Brazil, and another is visualizing the sex ratio by industry. The one that I selected is much more light hearted and simple, but I don't think that makes it less interesting, or shows laziness of any kind. It shows the Ratings of Japanese Instant Shio Ramen, and represents the reviews through a bar graph that has been made to look like noodles being held up by chopsticks! This one mostly caught my eye because I thought it was cute, and it is clear the creator paid a lot of attention to the details of this vis. It is very simple, and it provides exactly the information you would expect from reading the title: ratings of different ramen brands, which are labeled next to each noodle bar. The length of the noodle corresponds to the rating, and there are lines and labels to make it clear which bars represent which ratings. It is fun to look at, and provides information clearly and concisely. I could see someone encountering this vis and looking for their favorite brand to see how it stacks up, but personally, as someone who doesn't eat a lot of ramen, I would use this to see which are the most highly rated, so that I may consider trying those at some point if I'm ever craving noodles.
