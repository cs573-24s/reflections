by Aron Strandberg I added the name too because this week I was looking at tools used in Data visualization and I noted this author. He has most of his visualizations done in R. In this visualization which is named "A timeline map of the global median age from 1960-2060" on the website I found it, focuses on world population by age and it is beautiful how  he has the whole world map and  demonstrate how the population will be up to 2060 is so beautiful and easy to follow.

I also like the colors used like when in teen years, it is represented by green and the color gets darker as the age grows. I am not sure why he picked these color combination but it looks very good. I translated them like when one is young they can be referred to as green and that is why the colors fascinated me. 

Although this visualization is beautiful, I think it would have been more flexible to use if there was an option to choose a continent or a country to view instead of just the whole world.
