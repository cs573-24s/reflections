Atlas by Nomic is a data visualization that demonstrates Nomic’s ability to visualize unstructured data and text. In this example visualization, all wikipedia articles are labeled by a dot in a hive map. This fascinating viz maps 250K+ wikipedia articles with hundreds of words of information per each. In this interactive viz, the view settings allow the user to change the color, the point size and the ‘Nomic’ topics giving them a sense of control over what information is being seen. When in the farthest view, the visualizations is a beautiful explosion of colors looking like a firework has just been set off or a galaxy of stars and planets. The pathos of this visualization captures the feeling of how much information is really out there, especially with only one source being demonstrated here. As the user scrolls in, more general topics appear allowing the user to find more narrowed and filtered topics based on their preference. When hovered over a dot, the user is able to see a summary of the wikipedia article on the left. This simple interaction within the UI/UX allows the user to feel the sophistication of the technology.

Overall, this visualization was very attractive and I enjoyed greatly interacting with it. Nevertheless, the question of “What is the purpose of this visualization?” arose in my head. I do not think its purpose is to help researchers find more wikipedia articles related to certain subject, rather, I believe the goal is to simply visualize big data in a stylistic manner. Being able to extract information from a visualization this size with an enormous variation of information is near impossible. Nevertheless, Nomic does a great job at demonstrating what unstructured data can look like in a visualization.
