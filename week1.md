## Reflection
As a huge baseball fan, FiveThirtyEight's *who will win the World Series* visualization caught my attention. Although FiveThirtyEight is no longer publishing sports visualizations as of June 2023, I felt this mid-season prediction was actually a perfect chance to see just how accurate their prediction was. All teams are available to view, but for my analysis I focused on our hometown Boston Red Sox.

On loading the page, my eyes immediately pop to a loud "Red Sox have a 2% chance of winning the World Series" caption, highlighting both the Red Sox and their 2% chance in red, the team color. I can tell this graphic is polished not only by the color coordination, but also the fact that key captions are centered and made larger than surrounding text. I'm presented next with a table of all teams in the AL East division (the Red Sox's division) with team names and records, a number of games back, and a percentage chance to make the playoffs and win the division. Yet the team record isn't labeled as such -- one viewer might know "39-34" refers to Boston's win-loss record, but another viewer might not be familiar with the format. Similarly, what exactly is "games back?" A tooltip or hover-over would be useful for many viewers. The keystone prediction of "chance to make playoffs" and "chance to make division" is also not described, only left as an arbitrary percentage. As a reader, I'm left wondering where these numbers came from.

The next graphic is of pitcher ratings, refering to only *starting* pitchers by introducing pictures of each pitcher's face as a bubble that grows larger with every game they start or are scheduled to start. Rightmost pitchers perform better, leftmost pitchers perform worse. There are clever hover-overs for each pitcher to learn their name and relative score, but the axis isn't labeled -- what does this number represent? Win percentage if they start? FiveThirtyEight describes this as "our modelâ€™s prediction of how a pitcher will perform in a typical start" but that label feels very arbitrary, and I'm not sure if it's intended to be out of 100. 

The final three graphics relate to upcoming games, the team's rating relative to other teams, and completed games. Similarly, arbitrary "team rating" and advantages for starting pitchers and home field advantage are used, but with no way of telling where these numbers came from or what exactly they represent. The graphic on team rating shows the Red Sox as being a slightly-above average team...which doesn't exactly match their only a 2% chance of winning the World Series nor that they are 5th place of the 5 teams in their division. How are these determinations made? Finally, the statistics of completed games relative to the model's prediction show that the model predicted incorrectly in all of the last 5 games...yet this is portrayed as a checkmark when something such as an X, or another column to show model accuracy, might be more useful at first glance. I would be interested to see overall statistics on model performance for all teams over the course of the season.

Finally, a small text at the bottom describes predictions as an ELO-metric based on 100,000 simulations of the season. I wish this had been displayed sooner and more prominently, but it makes me understand how certain predictions were derived. This visualization gives me a lot to think about as I begin to design my own visualizations, especially in order to make sure the user can understand how my data is determined and what certain columns represent.
