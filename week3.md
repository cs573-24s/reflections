The viz that I explored this week : https://www.jamesrounddesign.com/presidents-data-viz

I have always been interested in history and decided to take a look at related visualizations. I came across this viz about the presidency from George Washington to Obama. The visualization is arranged in a grid which makes it easy to read information from left to right. I do like this visualization as it is color-coded with simple horizontal bar graphs. It is clear to see the age and terms of each president as well as the other related information. One thing that I have noticed in other visualizations is that despite being colored, they don't always provide a key. I don't think every visualization needs a key as some are straightforward or use colors to show different entities. In the case of this viz, it uses specific icons/shorthand to represent different experience levels or education. Without a key, none of them would make sense. This makes me think about how I should be approaching when making visualizations. If my goal is just to show the difference between each type of data, then a simple color code with a legend would be fine. If I were to design the viz with a specific theme in mind and present the data in my own organization, then a key might be necessary. The reason that I might not see a key with visualization often because the goal of the design is to make it easy to understand. Though this viz gives me an idea as to when a key is necessary.
