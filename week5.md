The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2023 is a visual representation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, showcasing interactive storytelling and data visualizations. 
Additionally, it presents trends for selected targets for each goal and provides insight into the measurement of certain SDGs. 
You can select one of the SDGs you want to focus on, let's say SDG 1: **No Poverty**.
The goal of SDG 1 is to eradicate poverty by the year 2030. Prior to the pandemic, 659 million individuals were struggling to make ends meet on less than $2.15 per day. 
Unfortunately, the pandemic brought progress toward eradicating extreme poverty to a halt, resulting in an additional 70 million people living in extreme poverty. 
Despite this setback, it is possible for poor countries to achieve economic growth and eliminate extreme poverty without significantly contributing to global emissions. 
We can read the full story about this goal more and we can scroll down there will be some interactive chart. For example:

In my opinion, this viz is one of the best I have ever seen in discussing SDGs. Not only give us pleasant charts but also important explanations in every section. The design is quite interactive between sections without losing readability and keeps the reader curious to scroll down. The color choice is excellent, and this could be made on Tableau, or maybe they have their own software to make this viz. Lots of features are offered without confusing the reader and are quite user-friendly.
