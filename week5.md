The conversation visualisation. Designed as a star where it starts with one dot. The first person starts a conversation and the other people jump in. The visualization is so cool that it tracts the conversation by color meaning that one person is tracked with color purple the other one with color green and the other with orange. 
Each level of the " tree" characters the characters keep on increasing like more people become part of the conversation. In some parts, the characters are there but they are not commenting and in some tree levels one characters is talking more hence the same color appearing multiple times.
The visualization also has a picture associated with each character so it becomes easy to follow for the reader. Overall it is not just a conversation, it a song, it is a hip-hop music and it is beautiful. As you go down you will discover that some characters leave the song/conversation
