### Overview
Alluvial chart visualizations are helpful when exploring how proportions change over time. For example, this visualization of 200 years of immigration to the United States shows how the proportion of immigrants from different parts of the world has changed through the years. It presents a comprehensive view of the patterns of immigration to the United States from 1820 to 2015. It effectively encapsulates the fluctuating trends of immigrants obtaining lawful permanent resident status, segmented by region or selected country of last residence. This visualization not only reflects the quantitative aspects of immigration but also subtly hints at the socio-political factors influencing these patterns.

### Design and Encoding Techniques
The visualization employs a time-series line chart, where the horizontal axis represents the timeline from 1820 to 2015, and the vertical axis indicates the number of immigrants (in millions). Each line in the chart corresponds to a specific region or country, differentiated by unique colors. This color-coding enhances the readability and allows for easy comparison between different regions. Key historical events, like the Immigration Act of 1924, are not explicitly marked but their impact is visible in the trends.

### Critical Evaluation
While the visualization excels in presenting a clear and comprehensive overview, it could be enhanced by incorporating interactive elements. Allowing users to hover over specific points for more detailed information, such as the exact number of immigrants or the socio-political context of that period, would add depth to the understanding. Additionally, a brief annotation of major historical events directly on the chart could provide valuable context for interpreting the data.
