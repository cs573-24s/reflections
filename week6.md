The Shape of Change is an interactive visualization designed to assess how well individuals can estimate how much the world has changed over time. The scrollytelling format allows users to effectively navigate through the narrative, which periodically provides opportunities for users to guess whether a certain metric has increased or decreased since 2010. While scrolling, users can view a progressive timeline on the left-hand side that features articles relating to health, the environment, or education.

The interactive portions involve moving a purple dot on a graph to create a slope of either negative or positive change. Depending on the user's answer, the visualization proceeds to reveal the true answer along with reasoning for it. Personally, I found this aspect of the visualization especially unique. Though I've analyzed interactive graphics before, the right or wrong nature of this made it feel a lot more like a game (which subsequently led to it capturing my interest more successfully). Moreover, I found the overall design of the visualization to be especially tasteful, as the text was easy to read and the colors were relatively pleasant to look at (thankfully there were no alarming neon oranges).

As for potential improvements, I really don't have much. If anything, I wish there were more headline-interactive pairs available to play around with. Since there are only 5, I think it would be cool to add a few extra for greater breadth (or even including topics beyond the health, environmental, and educational scope).
