### The Changing Nature of Middle-Class Jobs

This visualization, created by Gregor Aisch and Robert Gebeloff, illustrates percecantage change in middle class jobs.
The graph provides a clear temporal comparison, from 1980 to 2012, allowing for an analysis of trends over a significant period.
The use of lines to connect the same occupations over the years provides an immediate visual cue of the trajectory of each job category.
Color-coding is used effectively: blue for male-dominated occupations and red for female-dominated ones, with the gender ratio indicated by the position on the horizontal line for each occupation.
The layout is clean, despite the complex information being presented, which enhances readability and comprehension.
The inclusion of specific job titles (e.g., "Registered nurses" or "Police and detectives") provides concrete examples that ground the abstract data in reality.
It incorporates subtle design choices, like the thicker line for the "Registered nurses" category, drawing attention to significant shifts or points of interest.
The categorization of jobs into broader groups (like "Technicians" or "Skilled production workers") helps in comparing related occupations.
The viz offers a narrative of change, like indicating a shift from male-dominated jobs to more diversified roles.
