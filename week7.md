While Infinite Craft is not a display of typical data, as the output is AI generated, the AI is still pulling from the information on the internet it was trained on, so it is a secondhand demonstration of the connections between words and how the knowledge on the internet builds the connections between these words. I think the aspect of making it into a game with non-specific goals encourages people to explore more than they would have, making their own missions, and is far more engaging than simply giving a spread of words that the AI generated. Each word, or idea, being represented with both an emoji and a word, is a good way to visually differentiate the words from each other. Additionally, it is a good use of the technology, since AI is eerily good at generating relevant emojis. In terms of the "nodes" that end up being used, they are a little confusing. I like the simplistic aesthetic since it allows the focus to be put on the words. But there is an odd thing going on with the interactions between nodes that I don't understand; I believe it is trying to show potential connections that each word has, but this could be better explained. In terms of the sidebar of words, I think it is probably the worst part of the visualization, as it is simply a list of words. I think some form of sorting by category or more options to sort by would be a good addition to improve user accessibility and use. Finally, commenting on the whole usage of the visualization, I think it is very good. There is a brief tutorial to familiarize people with the methods of use, the sounds and banners help incentivize people to explore and find new words, and overall it is a very fun way to experiment how words connect with each other and visualize it. However it could benefit with a little more organization and structure to aid in understanding.
