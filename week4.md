This is a star mapper visualization and I like the way the data has been presented.
The use of buttons to change or choose visualization is so cool. 
They also have the play button the 3D visualization. 
It is so beautiful well-presented data. 
It has descriptions of each selection, which is brief, and giving a good context of what the user is looking at. 
I like the colour contrast like black background, white text is so beautiful to look at, and it is not scrollable which 
I think is a good thing for the user. So the way they used the space is so remarkable because they have many data that 
could fit more pages but it is one page and not scrollable.  I thought this is worthy sharing
