This interactive tool allows users to explore a dataset of 3,840 selfies collected from Instagram. 
The tool is designed to provide insights into selfie trends and characteristics across different demographics and locations.
The application is divided into two parts: the upper section, which displays various charts acting as filters, and the lower section, which shows images matching the selected filters. 
Users can filter selfies based on demographics like city, age, and gender; pose characteristics such as direction faced or head tilt; features including eyes, mouth, and glasses presence; and estimated mood. 
There is a feature that I find interesting. 
That is; the filters are interconnected, showing how changing one aspect, like selecting only female selfies, affects other characteristics like age distribution and city representation. 
Users can click on city maps to filter by location, and the application uses both human judgments and automatic methods for analyzing the selfies.
