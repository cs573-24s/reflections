This data vis is a website that explores a new way of visualizing stock market data. The visualizations main section is a spatial map of all major publicly traded companies. The spheres are sized by market capitalization, and the coloring can be selected by a drop down menu in the bottom left with a legend accompanying it. On the right hand side is a more detailed explanation of the visualization and information on how to read it. As you explore the visualization you can hover over different companies to see major info about their stock including important statistics like P/E ratios, EBITDA, etc. If you click on a company then the right hand side is populated with more detailed information about the company, and its financial data. This includes an interactive graph of the stock price over time, and the ranges of the statistics for all companies within that companies sector. You can also view a time chart of the commpanies income statements. Laslty in the right hand side you can search for a specific company, or you can select a specific industry or index to highlight in the main map.

I found this visualization incredibly useful. The stock market is vast and complex and companeis have lots of information present to perspective investors. Having a way to visually encode this data, and aggregate sector data and compare is a great tool. I liked that you can select which sectors, or indexes you want to look at, however I when you do this all other points are greyed out, rather than the map rescaling and only including the selection, which I think would have been more useful. I also like that the colors are consistent with blue generally meaning good and red generally meaning worse on any color scales with the exception of some stats as it is more subjective what good and bad are. I alos really liked how the right hand side was laid out and allowed a user to compare a current company to the rest of that companies industry. I also liked that the designer included a 2D view option as the 3D view can be a little hard to explore. One critique that I have is that the positioning of the spatial map is not super clear, but I suppose thats the nature of them as the groupings are based on similarity of companies across their many attributes which can be hard to map to lower dimensions. I also found the inclusion of a map tour to be very useful in understanding how everything works. My last critique would be that the right hand side can be a little small when trying to read the extended details and stats of a company, allowing for this column to be expanded or pop out could be helpful for a viewer.
