After gaining recent interest in scrolley-telling visualizations, I have found one that caught my eye. “The Clubs that Connect the World Cup” by Gregor Aisch is an interactive scroller-telling visualization that demonstrates how different players in the 2014 World Cup were connected to their professional clubs and country. While outdated (and laggy), these visualization are captivating and attract the user to scroll to find out more. In the introduction viz, the usage of a circular network graph allows Aisch to connect countries with their clubs. These clubs-dot size are labeled by the quantity of players coming from the certain club. So, from the viz it is clear that Manchester United and Bayern Munich had the most players playing in the World Cup. By using pre-attentive attributes, the user can easily see which clubs are the “biggest” amongst the football community. As the user scrolls down, they see a further analysis of an archival matchup between Brazil and Argentina and what teams connect players from both nationalities. Impressively, the author also included pictures of players who are well-known. The following network categorizes the clubs by colors to indicate which league they reside in. At the bottom most of the page, the user left a handful of filters to further mess around with the initial network. 

I enjoyed this visualization a lot. Its ability to visualize these connections was a lot of fun to explore and mess around with. Best of all, the entire dataset came from one source… FIFA.
