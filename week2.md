This is a graphic that I found while browsing some of the older forum posts and found it in reference to an older article about the Iraq war. I think this visualization is very purposeful and well done, but I question some of its choices regarding its purpose. I'd say this diagram has a distinct purpose: to present its data in a way that outlines the costs of war in a visceral way, and they used the image of dripping blood which happened to coincide with the data in a certain way. Obviously had they chosen to portray the deaths by year it would not have created the same imagery, so the scaling of the graph is well done. The coloring is also very powerful, the red being the only color causes it to stand out whenever it appears. I think the adding of text describing specific events during the war helps to put the image into context, and I think all the text chosen is good. All in all, the blood drip is very well done. However, I question the rest of the page, and even the necessity of including this information. The stuff about coalition fatalities and range of deaths in combat is very tangential, and takes backstage to the blood part of the graph, and I found myself a bit in the dark as to their purpose and sometimes even their meaning. For instance, the numbers in "the biggest killers" section dont come close to adding up to 113,000, are those deaths simply unknown or are there causes that weren't included? Are the "Iraqi security forces" those allied to the Coalition or part of Saddam Hussein's government? It is data that I think is important for the whole picture, but should have been included in follow-up graphs that could explain more in depth or be more fleshed out. Not only are these graphs slightly confusing, they take away from the visceral reaction of the red bloodstain - I think this data vis would be much stronger with just that. However, the paper might have been accused of being biased towards the iraqi viewpoint, and put in the coalition casualties as an offset? I'm unsure of their purpose but I know with them in another location this graphic would be much better.
