This is an informative visualization that focuses more on the artistic side rather than technological aspects. I plan for my next visualization to look at the opposite.

Through it's cartoonish qualities, this visualization engages the user very well. Coloring is used in a way that makes sense, color coding various events such as revenue and making it so the coloring makes sense (such as with tinder gold).
You can see what year each event happens in, but there's no sense of timing within years, unless we can assume events' timing are based on percentage of the year complete.
It was interesting in hearing tidbits such as how tinder was invented, and a story being showcased through the rivalry with Bumble.
Tidbits are also well shown through small imagery, like college students being represented by bottles. At the bottom of the visualization, there is also another that showcases revenue of the company changing over time. 6 pie charts is an effective way of showing that, but I would be interested in coding an animated version of this in the future.âˆ‚
