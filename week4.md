This week I reviewed another very cool tableau visualization which you can find here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/asha4359/viz/SuperheroesvsSuperheroines/MainPage?_gl=1*14yyntv*_ga*MTc2MjU2MzM1LjE2Mzk0NTA0MjU.*_ga_8YLN0SNXVS*MTcwNzM0ODEyMy41My4wLjE3MDczNDgxMjMuMC4wLjA./

The superheroes vs superheroines themed-visualization highlights how gender and marvel comic book hero trends have progressed over the past decade. The biggest thought being put across through this visualization is the huge imbalance in gender representation in comics. Through visualizations showing different genders as shapes, spelling out the name MARVEL, it sends out a strong message about the overpowering male dominance in Marvel comic books. The visualization also makes a statement by showing and allowing us to interact with filters that highlight the popular characters of all time within the comics, and we notice how all of them are male. It further shows a graph showing the progression of the introduction of male/female/agender/genderfluid characters across the span of about 70 years starting in 1950. 

This visual is particularly eye-catching and has many interactive features. It highlights an important problem with a lot of media and specifically it's potrayal of women in positions of power, or lack thereof. A few concerns with the visualizations are firstly, it was hard for me to tell what part of the visualization were interactive and which weren't. Also, the 'summary' graphs stood out compared to the rest of the visualization as they did not follow the same artistic style. However, overall I think this visualization is able to convey the message it intends to in a fairly effective manner. It always amazes me the incredible diversity of things you can do with a drag and drop tool like Tableau.
