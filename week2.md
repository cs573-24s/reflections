This week, I analyzed a visualization from BetfyUK called "The Internet in Real Time". You can find the same visualization at the following link: https://betfy.co.uk/internet-realtime/#

I was very excited when I came across the title for this visualization. However, I am left feeling a little disappointed.

The visualization shows how statisitcs like number of users, likes, or revenue for popular apps/websites increases over a period of time. The numbers showing the relevant stats on the tiles increase with every second. You also have the option to click on hour, day or month options showing you what the numbers would look like at the end of that time period. Hovering over a particular company shows more statistics about it's usage. For example, hovering over the facebook tile shows it's active users, users logged onto the site, new profiles, number of video views, and photos uploaded. The visualization also contains statistics for companies like instagram, snapchat, iCloud, booking.com, netflix, amazon prime, etc. 

It is very clear that a lot of time and effort was put into the data collection process for this visualization. However, the sources for their data are not listed explicitly, which raises a red flag to me. Specifically regarding the visualization, the main thing that bothers me is the clutter. Bright colored tiles with a whole bunch of numbers attached to them. It is hard to make sense of the scale of the numbers and compare the usage, revenue, etc across the board, making the visualization almost pointless.

Suggestions to make (in my opinion) this visualization more useful are:
1. Group categories of apps/websites: This way we are able to compare across different apps better. Furthermore, showing this data in terms of a bar chart, line chart, or anything more intuitive than just a plain number would help.
2. Colors!: Using white text on bright yellow background is hard to read. More contrast in the visualization would go a long way.
3. Clarity: When was this data collected? How was it collected? More information on the data collection process gives users clarity and a sense of trust in the visualization.
