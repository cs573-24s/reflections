"Cocktails" is an interactive visualization of 77 different alcoholic beverage recipes. Users are able to select the type of liquor-based cocktail recipes they'd like to see (e.g., champagne, rum, tequila, etc.). The visualizations shown depict the proportions of cocktail ingredients in their respective serving glasses. Overall, I felt this visualization topic was fun and easily accessible to readers of all backgrounds.

This being said, I think this visualization could've benefitted from additional interactive features. For instance, I think a hover to view recipe functionality would've been a very nice addition. As it is now, the recipes are just shown in flat text against the glasses, making it rather boring to scroll through after a while. Since personally I'm not a fan of reading recipes in the way they're displayed in this visualization, I think the addition of a formal recipe that users could download or print would make this visualization more practical/useful. 

Moreover, from a visual accessibility standpoint, I think that the font and spacing is a little thin, making some recipes harder to read. For example, the Bramble recipe had to squish "1.5 Blackberry Liquer" within the confines of the cup and liquid pictured. This is also an afterthought, but I also think they should include units someplace for readers to reference. Personally, I've never formally made cocktails (as in, measured anything out), so I can't tell if 1 lemon juice means an ounce, a whole lemon, etc.
