There is a close relationship between data visualization and deep learning, and they support and enhance each other on multiple levels.

Understanding and interpreting data: data visualization is an important tool for understanding and parsing datasets in the initial stages of a deep learning project. Through visualization, researchers can quickly identify patterns, outliers, distributions, and correlations in the data, which helps in making more informed decisions before building a model.

Visualizing Model Structure: Deep learning models, especially those complex neural networks that contain a large number of layers, can be understood more intuitively through visualization techniques. Visualizing the structure of these models helps researchers and engineers understand how the model works, including how the layers are connected and what each layer does.

Training Process Monitoring: Visualization techniques are used to monitor key metrics such as loss function and accuracy during model training. These visualizations help researchers keep abreast of the training process, identify possible problems (e.g., overfitting or underfitting), and adjust model parameters to optimize performance.

Explaining model decisions: Deep learning models, especially deep neural networks, are often considered "black box" models because their decision-making process is not transparent. Data visualization techniques, such as feature activation maps and class activation mapping (CAM), can help reveal the input features that the model values when making a particular decision, increasing the interpretability of the model.

Presentation of results: after model training is complete, it is very effective to use data visualization to present the performance and results of the model. For example, in an image recognition task, the original image can be displayed in conjunction with the regions recognized by the model to visualize the accuracy and potential errors of the model.

Augmentation Learning: In some types of deep learning, such as augmentation learning, visualization is used not only to show the final results, but also to understand the entire learning process. By visualizing the agent's decision-making process, reward patterns, and learning progress, researchers can better understand and optimize their learning strategies.
