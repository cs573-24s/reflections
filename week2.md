## Reflection
Yuck! I'm not sure how to begin with this visualization. I stumbled across it while exploring eagereyes.org, and it immediately caught my attention since I remember seeing many graphs and charts about COVID during the height of the pandemic -- like WPI's COVID dashboard. But this particular graphic is confusing, hard to interpret, lacks a good sense of scale (only year/seasons), and as mentioned, is off-center.

To start...I don't immediately know what I'm looking at. I see a spiral, but it doesn't start in the center -- slightly above it. A cone of red (good thematic choice) describes increasing case numbers, up to 150k, but it's hard to interpret numerical scale, only relative. It's clear that numbers are a 7-day rolling average as labeled, and each loop lasts one year which does provide great scaling in terms of magnitude, but the author describes the downside of this meaning the spiral itself has to be uncentered which makes it feel very squished. Despite this, seasons are made clear at each edge being the same month on each year, and despite scaling being required since as the spiral gets larger a "year" has to stay uniform in size.

I wish there was more of a strict numerical breakdown ___"how many cases are at this point?"___ to allow me to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation. The end of the spiral, with a large open cone, is striking in its magnitude but doesn't give me a good fixed measurement. Overall, I think this graphic might grab a reader's attention at first, but leave them confused at anything more than a quick glance.
