**Reflection 2**

**Motivation:** Search for easy and simple to understand visualizations that narrates multiple events in a timeline.

**Observations:**

Observations:

I am very interested in learning US Military History. However, I do not always remember the timeline of major events/conflicts. This map seemed very simple yet captured important details. This interactive visualization divides U.S. military engagements into horizontal categories. The temporal representation is also further divided into 4 labels based on the scale and reasons for the wars. The historical phases make it easier to group these events while interacting with the visualization. The color coding is simple and separates categories and labels. Figure 2 shows the inverse of figure 1 using simple visualization techniques of a dot marker on the timeline that allows readers to quickly assess the frequency and duration.
