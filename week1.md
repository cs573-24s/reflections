The page "TGV: A Visualization Tool for Temporal Property Graph Databases" presents a framework called TGV for visualizing temporal property graphs. The paper addresses the need for visualization tools that allow users to navigate graph data across time in temporal property graph databases.

The paper highlights the importance of considering the temporal dimension in graph databases, as real-world networks change over time. By incorporating temporal information into graph databases, it becomes possible to capture and analyze time-varying relationships and properties. The authors propose an extension to property graphs, called Interval-labeled Property Graphs, which introduce timestamped temporal validity intervals for nodes, relationships, and properties.

To address the challenge of visualizing temporal property graphs in a user-friendly manner, the authors developed the TGV framework. TGV provides a platform for interacting with and visualizing temporal graphs. It offers features such as a slider bar for navigating across time and tools for pruning the initial graph to reduce complexity. Users can write T-GQL queries within an editor panel, and the query results are displayed graphically, allowing interactive navigation of the temporal graph.

The framework contributes to the field of graph database visualization and opens up possibilities for temporal analysis and insights in various domains.
