This week I did my reflection on a visualization I found on r/dataisbeautiful. It shows the top 20 Olympic medal earning countries, and splits it up by gold, silver, and bronze. The vis caught my attention because it is colorful and fairly unique, I haven't seen too many charts that look like this. It gives the reader a sense of the order of the countries that have won the most medals, but does not provide any numbers. I think that this is a double-edged sword, as many numbers would clutter this chart significantly. However I think that it would be interesting if when you hover over a country you could see the breakdown of the number of medals they've one in each category, so that you can get a sense of numerically what the chart is representing. As someone who doesn't know that much about the Olympics, I have no context for how many medals even the United States has won that would help me put the order of the rest of the countries into perspective. Overall I don't feel like I learned that much from this visualization, aside from the order of the countries that have the most medals. I'm also unclear whether the ranking of countries that have won the most medals overall is the same as the rankings of countries that have won the most gold, silver, and bronze medals. Looking at the chart, the order doesn't change when you hover over the different medal types, however I would think it would be possible for a country that is, for example, ranked 10th for number of overall medals, but could be ranked 8th or 9th for number of bronze, silver, or gold medals. Maybe the author felt like that information wouldn't be helpful, and it would just be more confusing if the order changed depending on the view of the chart. I could see that being true, and would understand why they didn't take that into account if that was the case.
