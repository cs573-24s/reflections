Pie charts, as shown by class, are typically hard to use, because of size comparisons being hard to understand. 
When it comes to something like this visualization, one for the many countries out there, this would be a hard task.
This visualization combats this by turning the circle into parts, puzzle pieces to fit in.
There are a lot of strategies that are done that make this easy to read.
For one, the color scheme makes sense. Instead of a key being a list of names, it's instead the familiar image people know for countries. 
Colors are typically distinct, with some close variations not being immediately next to others. Regardless, some more color choices would've been appreciated. 
Colors are not only based on countries but reion of countries, signifying differences between parts.
The use of lines are very interesting in the chart. The thicker the line, the greater the distance between them, with the bigger lines signifying a distance of water between the two. 
A chart like this isn't easy to do, and is prone to oddities, like with rest of c. asia and uzb not fitting with the other components, and some size comparisons being hard to tell, like yem vs sau. So I would not be interested in doing something like this for this scale of data.
