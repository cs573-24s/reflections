This article is interesting becuase it take's an engineer's perspective into the science of weightlifting, and uses powerful data visulaization to debunk weightlifting myths and make it's argument. The first visualization is interesting because on top of showing a line chart with a roughly normal distribution, the author overlays zones onto the graph to further illustrate that the increase and decrease in hormones is linked to different bodily functions. The author goes on to use a unique data visualization - a pendulum - to illustrate the strength of these different zones. He then overlays the pendulum over the line chart to show the strength of the anabolic response. I think that this was a very creative way to combine different types of visualizations to create a narrative, however I think it was possible to do this in a more effective way, such as by introducing the third dimension into the graph. Later on in the dissertation, the author shows a graph of a stacked bar chart that is segmented into different categories ordered by size. He does this in order to create a logarithmic curve with his data, to show that the initial factor contribute much more of an impact than the succeeding ones. Elsewhere in the page, the author points out many areas where previous studies failed in their coverage of the subject, and highlights the key takeaways of his data. This helps to show why the data behind his graphs is effective, because the visualizations are only good when the material supporting them is proven to be correct. In addition, the authors usage of simple bar charts throughout the essay is amazing, because although bar charts are simple graphs, they are very useful to convey simple data and lead to fast conclusions in the reader.
