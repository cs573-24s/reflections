This data vis is a webpage talking about the irregularities of MLB baseball fields, which is a sport known for many rules and regulations. The page starts with some paragraphs explaining the context and a fun visualization that traces the fields of every MLB stadium. As you read on there is another visualization that traces the heights of the outfield fences for each stadium. Below this is some visualizations of the traces of different types of fields with a paragraph accompanying these fields explaining the history and facts about each type of stadium. These infographics also show the viewer other MLB stadiums that are similar to the type they are reading about. They also feature buttons to compare the field to all other MLB stadium traces, and there is a cool 3d view to see the outfield fence heights on the stadium.

I found these visualization very cool, as it shows how text and graphics can pair to tell a fun or intriguing story. In class we have also talked about how the use of animation can be dangerous at times as it can sometimes become too distracting, but I think in this case it was used perfectly. There is not much discrete data that a viewer of this webpage would want to grab from the traces of fields, so animating it is not distracting a user from extracting values from the graphic. Also these traces help to draw the reader in and become interested in the story. By the end of the animations there are many unique traces which quickly portrays what the writer wants to portray which is that MLB stadiums are very different. I also think that the 3d animation showing the raised fences was atention grabbing as well and is a nice touch that helps the user better visualize this spatial data. Some critiques I have are that for the compare feature, I think being able to select a specific park to compare one too would be nice and could help the user extract more value than just seeing many lines traced on top of eachother. I also think that at the end of the 3d animation if there was a pop up or hover feature to see the specific heights at the left center and right fields that could be useful to some readers. One thing that I really liked was the consistent use of color, and using colors that mapped to the team that a stadium hosts. This helps to maintain consistency and reduce any confusion or time it takes to understand what teams belong to what stadiums.
