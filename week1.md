## Introduction
Being my first time to Data Visialisation, I looked at a number of recommended resources 
and i found them all interesting however i found the  idea of Notebooks to be more facinating.
## Notebooks 
These are computing environments that allows for the users to share live code, visualizations as well as equations just to mention a few.
According to the resources I have used, these are not new but recently they have gained popularity because of a number of reasons:
1.	Sharing of data-Data is a scares resources and sometimes gathering of such takes time and slows down the processhence having it readily available for tests for example can help in 	a great way
2.	Notebooks allow the data sharing in various platforms like presentations, html, pdf even excel. I find it very flexible. IHowever I ddnt go in depth as to how this can be achieved
3.	Gives opportunity to data scientist and developers to experiment with the data or prototype things
## Examples of platforms that are using notebooks 
1.	JupyterLab is built in such a way that its users can configure flexible interfaces, arrange workflows in data science and machine learning just to mention a few. It has a modular 	design that allows for expansion and flexible functionalirity to enhance the functionality of the data as well as code. 
2.	Observable just like any notebook computing environmnets, Observable allows for the sharing of data as a resource in making decisions. 
They are many of such.
## The future 
Since they are flexible there is hope for more improvements
