I found upon a fascinating Gravitational Waves project crafted for Science News. 
This immersive visualization showcases a captivating space-themed experienceâ€”an interactive journey through the intricate tapestry of gravitational wave events. 
The design, featuring space-time ripples, is not only remarkably minimalistic and sleek but also delivers a wealth of information.
The mesmerizing spiral animation serves as a conduit to a trove of valuable data, offering insights into black hole mergers and cosmic smashups. 
Explore details such as the original and final mass of the mergers, total merger size, and various facets of gravitational wave events.
Since their discovery in 2015, LIGO and Virgo have identified 50 gravitational wave events, revealing the echoes of violent collisions between black holes or neutron stars spanning billions of years.
To mark the release of the 2nd catalog of mergers, Science News entrusted them with creating an interactive data visualization, both as a standalone digital experience and a companion piece for their printed magazine.
Their aim was to elevate the interactive aspect beyond a mere static visual. The final result not only unveils each event but also incorporates sound bites for select mergers. 
Hovering over a merger initiates a subtle physics-based animation, while clicking on any event reveals a detailed pop-up modal. This modal includes a sky map, illustrating the approximate location where the gravitational waves originated. 
The project seamlessly intertwines aesthetics and scientific depth, making the exploration of gravitational wave events an engaging and enriching experience.
