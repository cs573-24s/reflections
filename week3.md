Through a creatively rich visualization, we can overview the vast and complex information of known human civilization history.

Joseph Priestley gained fame through two chronological charts. One of them is the "Biographical Chart," illustrating renowned male figures, leaders, and philosophers over a span of 700 years. This chart allows one to instantly grasp the prominent male personalities active in this historical period. Despite its simplicity, the "Biographical Chart" remains one of the most significant visualizations in history.

In the second chronological chart, Priestley applied and expanded upon the techniques from the "Biographical Chart" to create the "New Chart of History." Similar to the first chart, it focuses on depicting major empires and civilizations that coexisted throughout history and their interconnections. Priestley innovatively introduced color, size, and creatively utilized the Y-axis. The result is a captivating visual narrative of history, rich with information. While this chart may appear dazzling at first glance, it embodies boundless creativity and stands as a pioneering work of innovation in its era.
