I've found this amazing [visualization](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/asteroids/#/home) of NASA's Asteroid wathch.
1. The NASA Asteroid Watch platform offers a visualization of asteroid 2024 CP5's trajectory.
2. It allows users to observe the asteroid's position relative to Earth over time.
3. The visualization is interactive, enabling users to manipulate the timeline for past and future projections.
4. Detailed information about the asteroid's size, speed, and distance from Earth is provided.
5. The platform aids in tracking potentially hazardous asteroids and studying their orbital dynamics.
6. It reflects NASA's commitment to monitoring celestial objects that could pose a threat to Earth.
7. Public engagement and awareness about near-Earth objects are encouraged through this visualization.
8. The visualization offers multiple viewing options, including 3D models and orbital diagrams.
9. It enhances scientific research and understanding of asteroid behavior.
10. Overall, the visualization contributes to planetary safety efforts and promotes scientific discovery in the field of astronomy.
