This visualization depicts the rent burden on low income families in the 25th percentile across american cities. Grouping the data to resemble the shape of the US is a helpful analogy that allows one to see the data spatially. The dividing lines for the different regions of the US also group certain parts of the data together and may emphasize points on which regions are more rent-burdened than others. The grouping within these certain regions also emphasize this. In particular, the west and southernmost part of the south atlantic are very red indicating a higher rent burden in these areas. The color scale seems to be effective, quickly allowing you to see which areas are the most rent burdened. New York City also stands out especially. However, a good portion of it seems to be shades of red compared to other colors, which may be manipulating the intepretation a little; on the other hand, 30% is already a pretty high percentage of income to spend on rent, so it makes sense that the warmer colors start from there. The range of the shades of red seem a bit small, though, which may make it a bit hard to differentiate between the light red and dark red. Overall it succeeds at sending the message that many low-income families are very rent burdened, especially in urban areas.
