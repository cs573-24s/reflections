# REFLECTION WEEK 4


This website uses a variety of data visualizations to show how black students in Pinellas County are failing in public schools. It primarily uses the following types of charts:

Line graphs: used to show changes in test passing rates and the level of racial integration of schools for black students across generations.

Scatterplots: used to compare the relationship between the test pass rate of black students and the school's poverty rate in different schools.

Bar graphs: used to rank the test pass rates of black students in different schools, as well as to show the vocabulary of singers in different music genres.

Maps: used to label the locations of the five worst schools in Pinellas County, as well as to show the vocabulary of hip-hop music in different areas.

Pie charts: used to show the racial makeup of students at different schools, as well as to show the percentage of words that are most characteristic of hip-hop music
