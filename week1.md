The visualization I explored this week was a Covid-19 Vaccination tracker published by Reuters. You can find the visualization here: https://github.com/cs573-24s/reflections.git.

I chose this visualization as I found a few things that I particularly liked. Firstly, the interactivity of the visualization. I think most visualizations get overlooked because of either their complexity or the dullness. As data visualizers, I think we need to try and find unique ways to grab our audience's attention, and I believe creating interactive visualizations allow us to do so. 

While playing around with the vaccination tracker visualization's globe, I noticed that it would be hard to compare the vaccinations given across countries. However, to dig deeper into the data, scrolling further down on the webpage provides more information on almost all the questions I had. They provide a list of countries ranked from most vaccinated received to least vaccinated, along with interactive tools such as clicking on the country to see more statistics along with graphs on the timeline of the vaccinations. They also list more qualitative information regarding the vaccianations in that country. The overall visualization also addresses how economic factors affect vaccinations. This particular visualization was harder to understand. The region and it's income graphs were separated into two different tabs, making it difficult to compare how economic status affected the vaccinations. You would have to individually hover over each bubble to find the country you want to compare the economic effect for. I think an improvement to this aspect is to use a map or a visualization where you can compare the economic and vaccination data with more ease. The only other concern I have regarding this tool is it's accessibility to people with color-blindness. The colors on the globe visualization particularly are all shades of green - which make it harder to discern the differences highlighted.

However, overall I think this tool is fairly effective at educating the general public on the state of vaccinations during the pandemic.
