This article created by TheUpshot presents a visualization that graphically illustrates the relationship between school quality, housing prices, and commute times in five major metropolitan areas across the United States. By using Redfin, Standford Education Data Archive, and the Censes Bureau, Bui and Dougherty were able to masterfully compile the necessary information and data to visualize their vision. The visualization incorporates color barriers to distinguish between commutes longer or shorter than 30 minutes, providing a clear indication of commute lengths. Additionally, a search bar feature allows users to easily find specific cities within the metropolitan areas for detailed information. Hovering over a bubble in the visualization highlights the corresponding school and displays exact details, fostering interactive engagement with the data. The size of each bubble represents the population density of the city where the school is located, offering further context to the data. The visualization emphasizes the trade-offs of living in suburbia, noting that while it may save money, residents often face longer commutes to school and reduced amenities compared to urban areas. 

As a whole, this simple demenstration of data was very appealing. My main qualm with this article/viz was the lacks of explanation for the positioning of city names on the chart, such as why Minneapolis ranks low while San Francisco ranks higher.
