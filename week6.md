This visualization is interesting because of the medium it is displayed through. This visulaizations utilizes scrollytelling, however it does so horizontally instead of vertically. The user can scroll through the visualization themselves, as well as use the arrow keys, press the speed of light travel button, or click on the "next event" arow keys or the planet symbol in the top navbar. I think that having the user scroll throuugh this vis is key in having the users understand how far apart the planets are, and just how much space there actually is in outer space. I do think that this process can get tiring though, and I think that vertical scrolling can be a more enjoyable experience for the user in experiences such as these. However, the ability to navigate with the top nav buttons help to make this easier. I think that this visualization could be further improved by adding more to catch the user's eye. The planets aren't particularly well designed - for example the sun is just one large yellow circle. Adding more content to the background, such are far-out stars and constellations, would help make the scrolling experience more fun and feel less like a chore. I also like how the author included the moons in the visualization, however he made the text small to the point where it is hard to read without squinting. I would also like to see a version where the entire visualization is zoomed out, so that you can see the entirety of the solar system in the end, to help visually compare the distances between the planets.
