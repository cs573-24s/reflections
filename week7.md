## Reflection
Time is strange. It's so hard to portray a large timeline in a nonlinear fashion, but this graphic on the history of pandemics portrays it pretty perfectly. My first impression is one of a path I follow towards me, seeing how as time gets closer to the present the years get closer together and more magnified, demonstrated by the rightmost axis simply labeled time. Although it might be helpful to include units, both those and the leftmost "death toll" axis are implicitly "years" and "people." 

But these nuances overlook the main attraction -- the pandemics themselves, portrayed as spiky colorful virus whose size represents its death toll. Although it's tricky to visualize if more distant pandemics were more large in scale (smaller population, timeline compressed, many years in duration) it's immediately obvious just how impactful they must have been in terms of the population at the time. Compared to the Spanish Flu and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, COVID-19 is a mere blip on the radar -- though certainly far more widespread than the similar SARS and MERS pandemics. 

I might point at several minute observations -- colors don't always align in cases such as the Japanese Smallpox epidemic nor the Smallpox or Yellow Fever visualizations, and certain years appear to not contain the full scope of the pandemics they represent, but overall the visualization is bright and immediately captivating.

My last observation is one of data analysis in the form of the pandemics sorted by death toll at the bottom -- it is immediately clear the immense scope of the Bubonic plague and how less impactful SARS/MERS, among others, were in comparison. Since data is properly cited and several handy descriptions/definitions are presented throughout the visualization, I feel inclined to trust it and share it as a helpful guide to pandemics throughout history.
