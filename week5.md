This visualization is very cool, because it takes a unique, eye-popping approach to data visualizations on a map. This map helps to visualize just how big the populations of prominent states like California, Massachusetts, New York, Florida, and Texas are. It also helps to show how land mass does not equate to total population, as Montana and Wyoming are both very small. However, this graph is a bit confusing. The graph tries to show certain counties to show that certain parts of the state are more densely populated. Though I think this makes the graph too cluttered, and would instead be better portrayed with a choropleth graph or a simple heatmap. Also, the graph makes use of different colors, which is not immediately clear to the users what the significance of this is. Upon further investigation, it seems as though four colors were chosen to further distinguish the boundaries between states. I like how the creator of the graph decided to use a hexagonal pattern, as this helps this graph stand out from other graphs. However, this doesn't seem to aid to the user's understanding of the data in any way, and I would not recommend this type of chart for any other reason than to be eye-catching.
