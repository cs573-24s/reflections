This straightforward data visualization effectively juxtaposes the number of mentions each character in the Harry Potter series receives in the book with their corresponding screen time in the movie adaptation. It employs opacity levels below 1 to ensure the visibility of overlapping data points. Furthermore, the use of data labels serves to distinctly identify the most significant characters throughout the entire series. The title, adorned with the iconic Harry Potter font, boldly communicates the graph's purpose to the audience. Additionally, the logarithmic scale is adeptly utilized to present the data in a more nuanced and fluid manner within the graphic. Moreover, the inclusion of a classification line offers viewers a clear understanding of how each character is positioned within their respective category.

The story this plot is attempting to tell is that some characters were underrepresented in the movies in relation to the times they were mentioned. When I sat and reflected on this graph it somewhat bothered me they were comparing mentions in book versus screen time. I strongly believe you can be mentioned in a book, but not need to appear on the screen in that scene. The word “mentions” does not carry enough value to be placed against the screen time in a film, so that is my primary qualm. Overall, this plot is very clean and succinct, therefore, attracting all Harry Potter fans like myself.
