The chart shows the most common job in every state of the U.S. as of 2014, based on data from the Census Bureau. The most common job across the country is **truck driver** üöõ, which is the top occupation in 29 states. This is because truck driving is immune to globalization and automation, and is needed everywhere. The second most common job is **software developer** üíª, which is the top occupation in 6 states, mostly in the West and Midwest. This reflects the growing demand for tech workers and the rise of tech hubs in Utah, Colorado, and Washington. The third most common job is **registered nurse** üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è, which is the top occupation in 5 states, mostly in the Northeast and South. This reflects the aging population and the need for health care workers. Other common jobs include secretary, teacher, farmer, lawyer, and retail salesperson. These jobs vary by region and reflect the economic and social trends of each state.
