Dashboard of the Present Future by Lindsey Poulter is an interactive visualization designed to facilitate comparisons between various countries, regions, and income levels. There are approximately 30 different metrics available, some of which are: control of corruption, GDP per capita, C02 emissions, and maternal mortality. The metrics displayed (though some remain consistent) generally vary slightly based on the option chosen to analyze. For example, if users choose to analyze by country the information shown answers the following question: How does INSERT COUNTRY compare to INSERT CORRESPONDING REGION and INCOME LEVEL countries across 30 metrics? Alternatively, if users choose to analyze by region the question answered is: How does INSERT REGION on average compare to the other Regions across 31 metrics? In addition to this flexibility, Poulter also included a methodology key and informative metric details to help readers understand what each metric means and why certain design choices were made. 

I felt this visualization was constructed well and provided a lot of interesting insight into relative developments around the world. Prior to this, I had never seen a visualization that broke down development information into overall social classes (usually I just saw by country and region). Moreover, I also found some of their more unconventional metrics (e.g parliament seats held by women) to be a nice addition and helped to paint a broader picture for comparison. 

As for things that could be improved upon, there are some discrepancies in the way data is represented in the axes that make it harder to derive meaning without actually selecting and reading the metrics individually. This is also pointed out in the methodology key, which states: "Stronger values are placed toward the top/outside. This means the axis may be reversed from a traditional chart. For example, infant mortality has a value of 10 at the top and 80 at the bottom. Additionally, the axis does not include 0. This is to emphasize the minimum and maximum values in the world". Though this information is provided, it lies at the bottom of the visualization, so if users do not scroll down to read it they may be unaware of this fact. Further improvements could also be made in adding some better options for shifting the text orientation on the wheel. Due to the shape, some metrics are perpendicular, which might make readers less likely to inspect the information over those which are displayed in more readable orientations. Personally, I think maybe letting users turn the wheel would add a nice touch on the interactive front and would help remedy the text orientation issues.
