World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks:ã€€https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/

The ilsutration I found this week is reporting on the larger data breaches from 2004 to 2023. It is constructed with circles in avrying sizes showing the amount records stolen. Clicking on the circle reveals more infomration about the breach. This visual is good in the sense that it quickly shows the companies that suffered the most. However, it is not an intuitive or friendly visual to navigate. One problem is has is that it is hard to tell what time of the year the breach happened. For the most part, I can tell what order the breach happened between the years, but much harder when the circles are small. One suggestion I have for the creator is that instead of making this visual vertically, make it horizontal with the year as the x axis and the circle on the y. This way it is easier to follow and makes it easier to view as a whole year. In additon, I think it is better to put the different breaches in the same column based on the year. This makes it less noisesy and the focus of the visual is more clear. The point of data visualization should be presenting the data in an intutive and easy to understand manner. It took me a while to undestand how this visual works and what it is trying to tell me.
