# Iraq's bloody tool

We do not often see y-axis on the top with downwards bars. This visualization, designed by Simon Scarr, succesfully employed y-axis inversion.
The visualization shows the number of deaths per month in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, inverting its y-axis and filling the bars in red to look like blood running down the page.
It emotionally hits you because of couple of reasons; 
1) The use of red color to resemble blood,
2) Bar chart with rounded end caps emphasize the metaphor of blood (think how line chart would look like),
3) y-axis inversion, making it look like blood running down the page.

The infographic also has information on how civilians died with buble charts, and it also aligns with y-axis on the top.

Overall, It is interesting to think about metaphors and how to apply them in visualizations. Small details, such as rounded end caps can chance emotional sense of readers, and increase the impact of story you are telling.
