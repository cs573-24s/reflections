Visualizing Population Density Patterns in Six Countries : https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/population-density-patterns-countries/

This visualization I found this week is visualizing population density in six countries. So far I feel like I have only explored 2D data visualization and haven't checkout 3D ones. I think utilizing 3D effects in data viz can be interesting. The set is done with R and a path-tracing package. I don't know much about path-tracing so I tried to find an example, which is called rayrender. (https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayrender) This package can build different scesn and provide diffrent types of surafces. I never thought how you could do this in R and create viz like this.

The visualization itself is straight forward with the denser the population, the darker and higher the pillars are. This creates an interesting image to view and we can easily locate which cities in the country has the most population. The color shcueme choice is also unique. The country is mostlky in white with the different shades of purple colored pillars standing above it. From a rendering perspective, I think that it creates nice constrast to the overall background making it astechically pleasing. Though I feel like there might've been better color choices. The visualization for Chile goes to show how different geography changes the location for its population. This makes me want to see what it would look for a more mountain heavy country. Overall this visualzaiton makes me want to try doing some kind of 3D visualization with rendering.
