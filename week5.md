This visualization is called Is It Better to Rent or Buy?
It's a calculator that retrieves the costs associated with buying a house and computes the equivalent monthly rent. it takes the most important costs associated with buying a house and computes the equivalent monthly rent. After adjusting all of the factors, you can see the results to the right: if it's possible to rent a place for less than the indicated amount, then renting is better. Otherwise, it's better to buy.
The factors are the Home Price, the Length of time they're staying in that house, mortgage details, the Home Price Growth Rate, Taxes, Maintenance and Fees, and Other Renting Costs.
I think it's interesting the linked graphs, also has a user-friendly interface, allowing users to adjust parameters like home price, mortgage rate, rent, and expected length of stay to see how each factor influences the decision to buy or rent.
The tool is great at breaking down and showing complicated money matters in an easy way for many people to get. But, it could be better if it got updates with the newest money info more often and looked at more types of costs when you own a home or rent, like repair costs or insurance, for a fuller picture.
