This is visualization simulates the average life of 1,000 Americans. I found this interesting in the way they explained the data using colors representing daily activities in regards to time during the day. There is time watch at the left, which helps one control and see what time of the day commands attention of a particular type of activity. The people are represented in dots and they are moving from one activity to the other. The graphic is beautiful to look at but it is complicated to understand what the movement is trying to symbolise. 
Although I think, the colors were well represented, I think the interpretation of it was not well thought of. I think they could have a legend to easily help the viewer understands the visualization. The owner tried to come up with some lines to enhance the description of the visualisation but it did not help much.
