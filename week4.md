This visualization features the winning times for each participant in the winter olympics 2010 for several sport categories. The dots look similar to a scatterplot and similarly implies patterns. These show trends such as how close together the athletes were and how far ahead the winning time was. Mousing over the dots also allows you to see the name and information about of the person and how many seconds they were behind, which is helpful for displaying information in a non cluttered way. The feature to "play" the race highlights the current dot in real time, which helps with perciving time in a visual way. The sound that plays as it hits each dot also helps with perciving time and allows one to "hear" the race in real time. It might also serve an accessiblity purpose. Besides that, though, I personally feel like it does not enhance the visualization all that much compared to the visual component. The volume also changes at times, though it is not as clear what it implies, and sometimes lags behind when there are a lot of dots clustered together. The winning time being portrayed as starting at the same time on the scale for every sport may also cause some confusion, but helps with comparing in between sports.
