This visualization is particularly intriguing because it utilizes a unique way of displaying data clusters. Although each point is only 50 people, you can see how people of different ethnicities conglomerate together in different parts of the region. It's interesting to see how in the modern age and in a progressive sector of the world, people still have a tendency to self-segregate into their different ethnic groups. This graph also calls into question whether there are different reasons why one ethnic group prefers one area over another. One gripe I have with the graph is that it is a bit too far zoomed out and is rotated slightly from being exactly NWES, so it makes it hard to accurately interpret the data, though it does make for interesting high-level conclusions. This visualization is particularly interesting to me since I just visited DC 3 weeks ago. On my way into the city, I realized that there was virtually no traffic at 11am. When I asked my Uber driver about this, he informed me that DC is a working city, and the traffic is horrendous between the hours of 7am-9am and 4pm-6pm, because 3+ million people commute into work every day. This information is important in understanding the graph, because although the graph is about displaying data in the greater DC region, the majority of these people are commuting into DC for work, which shows that this graph is a representation of the DC workforce, and these clusters drive the development in one of America's most important cities. In addition, when I as in DC, my small group and I were assigned to get lunch together at an arepa food restaurant in northern DC. If you look at the map, you will see that there is a huge cluster of El Salvadorian people in northern DC, and in the middle of this area is where I ate arepas, which is a staple of Latin American food. I think it is often that as a STEM student, it is hard to connect the numbers on a screen to real-life experiences and to notice their impact. That is what makes it special when you can connect your experiences to what you are working on.
