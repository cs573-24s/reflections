This week I found my visualization on r/dataisugly.
It portrays a map of the potato production in the United States, broken down by state.
The states are color coded based on the number of acres of potatoes harvested.
The more acres of potatoes harvested in a state, the larger the state is on the map.
This makes the map look extremely distorted and hard to read. 
The state of Idaho is the only state that fits into the largest acre range on the map, and it takes up essentially the entire western coast of the US on the map. 
This causes states like Washington, who produce a fairly large number of potatoes, to be placed where Alaska would normally be. (Alaska doesn't produce many potatoes suprisingly)
The Southeastern portion of the map is also a jumbled mess.
States that don't produce many potatoes are smushed into the Southeast and labled with numbers connected to a key.
The map actually isn't extremely hard to read once you are able to adjust to the strange layout and sizing.
The main problem is that upon first glance, a viewer may be lead to believe that they have just had a stroke.
