I found Selfiecity really interesting because it is a project that explores the world of selfies through data visualization. 
They gathered 120,000 selfies from five cities, selecting around 1,000 photos from each city. The project analyzed demographics, poses,
moods, and features to uncover insights into the culture and social behavior of selfie-takers. 

For instance, the findings revealed that women take more selfies than men, and people prefer taking selfies in public rather than private spaces. 
Despite the complexity of the study, the team effectively presented valuable insights using visually appealing data visualizations.
