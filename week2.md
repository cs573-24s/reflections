Week 2 Data Vis Reflection

This week I'm doing my reflection on a vis titled "Evolving Energy Landscapes: Per Capita Consumption
of Different Energy Types in India (1965-2021)". I found it by searching "d3.js" on Twitter and looking at the media tab. It
caught my eye because I am interested in energy management and sustainability. I really like that the author included important
events along the timeline that would provide some context to the changes in energy consumption. Since it's not really new information
that energy consumption has increased over time and new forms of renewable energy have been introduced, I find that the inclusion
of these contextual events is more interesting than the data by itself. Aside from thinking that more of these timeline points would be 
interesting, I have a few other suggestions for this vis. I think that the labeling is somewhat unclear at times, for one the labels don't
appear to be aligned with the sections of the data as they are highlighted, however there are the same amount of labels as there are 
sections of data, so they appear to be corresponding. Additionally, the 3rd and 4th labels are "Renewable Engergy" and "Other Renewable Energy" 
and its not clear to me what the distinction between these would be. I also wasn't sure exactly what kind of graph this was, and the author provides no 
indication of that. I beleive that it is a stacked area chart, however most of the examples that I found did not exactly resemble
this one. I think that the text could have been used a bit more effectively if it was moved off to the side rather than falling in the middle
of the chart, and that would have made room to add more points along the timeline for historical events. I also think that the visualization does not
lend it self well to presenting specific values for each energy type. Because the lines are stacked, the reader has to do mental math to determine the quantity
of energy used for most of the data types. I think that the purpose of this graph is not necessarily to present specific values but to show
visually how the quantities vary, but I think that adding labels for quantities at the end or begining could make it more useful for presenting
that quantitative data to the readers.
