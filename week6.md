I recently came across an interesting visualization project on The Washington Post that delves into the significant gender pay gap. The project provides a comprehensive view of the disparity from various angles, considering factors such as occupation, working hours, education attainment, experience, and geography. What stands out is its use of a clean calendar-based table, illustrating when women in different occupations essentially begin working for free. Moreover, the visualization shows the historical changes in earnings by the share of women in each job, and offering insights into the breakdown by education and workweek.

I tried to find some recent data, and the situation appears to persist without big improvement.
