The topic that I chose this week was a d3 template that I came across while working on A1. It is an animation showing the spread of open walmarts around the united States. I wanted to talk about this one because while what is conveying technically gets the point across, I find the animation extremely difficult to look at for a variety of reasons. The animation of spreading looks like some sort of virus, and the choice of item to display each walmart doesn't help much, personally triggering my tryptophobia. If this person was hoping for a visceral reaction to the displaying of this data, they got exactly that, but if the intent was to display this information in an unbiased way, this completely fails at that goal. I am honestly not sure how exactly these problems could be mitigated, as the 'spread' analogy is technically correct, but i have a few ideas. Rather than casting this as a purely store-centric map, the user could instead map out the areas that are serviced by these particular walmarts (some hopefully non-arbitrary radius around the store), and then use a binary coloring schematic to show the areas that are covered and which are not. Additionally, there could be some color scheme about the depth of coverage (how many walmarts cover a specific area). This would help emphasize the city regions which are very prominent in the original mapping, as a binary color scheme would leave this out. Another thing the creator could do, to de-emphasize the viral spreading analogy, is to give important landmarks textual backing, such as 'the first walmart in so-and-so state was founded now' with text matching this description appearing at the appropriate date. As a complete alternative, the displayer could ditch the precise-location oriented map entirely, and simply count the locations in each state, or do a bubble map where the size of each bubble inflates based on how many walmarts are in a particular state. While this loses some of the geographic data that was being put across, I think it would recast it in a much less charged way and eliminate some bias from the viewer.
