Chains of Affection: The Structure of Adolescent Romantic and Sexual Networks

Introduction:
This article describes the sexual network in a population of over 800 adolescents in Jefferson High School in a midsized town of midwestern United States. Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995.

Annotation:
Blue dot means male. Red dot means female. The lines in between represent sexual relationships

Goal:
The goal of this article is to show how local preferences governing partner choice shape the macrostructures in which individuals are embedded and hence affect both the potential for disease diffusion and the determinants of individual risk. Because the structure of sexual networks is critical for understanding the diffusion of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Data Visualization Method: (How to implement it in D3.js)
First, ask the students to identify their partners by a unique ID if their partner attended the same school. Then to generate a sexual map using d3, we need to format the data as a JSON object. Each node (student) and link (relationship) should be represented as separate entities. After setting up an HTML environment, we can load the data and create SVG elements for nodes and links, then use D3's force simulation for positioning nodes and links. Finally, we ajust the appearance such as color and size, and implenent zooming and dragging features.
