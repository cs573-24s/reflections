There's so much to this visualization it's overwhelming. 
Through text and updating visuals, this tells a story about the history of wine.
Some of the visuals are drawings that are being drawn on screen, being easy to visualize.
A really cool part of this is being understand the message through interactivity. You're able to update the quality of the wine through adjusting sliders for other variables, figuring out how the equation works.
Interestingly, an example was given as a part of it's explanation, with a strange tangent into supervised learning. 
Through coloring, the visualization determines what's good from what's bad, being up to the user to make the final call based on what they learned.
A lot of the visualization tricks on this are relatively simple, and could be easy to implement in d3 and html. Changing visuals and telling a story can bring a lot of power to a subject that's simple.
This visualization also has a stylistic sense, making most things hand drawn, giving it an identity to remember.
There is a few glitches of note on this, however. Changing the screen size has a tendency to mess with things, and I couldn't find a handle it mentioned for the last part. This is a really high quality visualization either way though.
