Global armed conflicts persist in regions like Palestine, Ukraine,etc. These conflicts are driven by the highly profitable weapons industry, primarily controlled by a few 
global nations. In 2022, the United States accounted for over 45% of global arms sales, with France at nearly 10%. Only 15 countries sell 95% of all global weapons, with NATO nations responsible for nearly 80% of these sales. Conversely, countries such as Qatar, India, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Japan collectively purchase half of the world's produced weapons. This geographical imbalance reveals wealthier northern nations manufacturing and selling weapons, while impoverished southern nations affected by conflict are the buyers. The text concludes by advocating for a shift away from the war logic, dismantling the arms industry, and promoting internationalism to foster human fraternity and universal emancipation.
