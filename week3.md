Reflection:This article introduces an unconventional chart, which may seem incorrect, can be more useful in conveying specific information and attracting more audience, since a more semantically meaningful representation can help us understand and use the data much more easily. The author holds that although the traditional data visualization purists may criticize, the breaking charts presentation can lead to better data insights and obvious connection between this data. For example, running pace by Andy Kirk, making bar chart where the vertical axis is upside down. However that makes for a much more relatable way of thinking about speed at human scale. And in Audio Software and Interfaces, in software iZotope RX, the decibel scale on the right goes from -âˆž to 0, up and down, and is not just seeing one infinity scale, but two. Finally, the author holds that we should find a way to think about charts in the context of expertise and use.
