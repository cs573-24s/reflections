The links lead to a visualization platform called Earth Nullschool, which offers a real-time model of global weather conditions, focusing on various parameters like wind, temperature, ocean currents, and more. It provides an interactive view of the global wind patterns, which can be educational and informative. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users to easily navigate and interact with the data. Users can zoom in and out and rotate the globe, which enhances the interactivity and accessibility of the information. One potential drawback is that the amount of data and the complexity of the visualization might be overwhelming for some users, particularly those without a background in meteorology or related fields. Real-time data updates are a strong feature, but ensuring that this information is as up-to-date and accurate as possible is crucial (the site updates every 3 hours for wind forecasting).
