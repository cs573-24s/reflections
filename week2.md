This visualization was created by Raul Mukherjee and Erin Davis to describe how the five biggest airlines in the world came to ‘control the skies’. My appeal to this visualization was that it is very sleek, eye-catching, and invites the viewer to look deeper into the information being seen. By using a tree-esque vis, the authors were able to see the different branches, or companies, being acquired based on the year. Small annotations throughout the graphic prove to be extremely helpful for the reader to understand the nuances and complexities of the vis. Stylistically, the authors use very simple, yet distinguishable colors to clearly mark the differences between the airlines they are trying to highlight. Additionally, the addition of the total marker on the right (with the same color) ensure the viewer knows the exact amount of acquisitions each signature airline has gone through in the past 60 years. Throughout the visualization, there are non-bolded markers indicating a significant airline being acquired. These markers allow the viewer to be able to see the notable airlines merging into what they are known as today. Graphically, the axis is well labeled and does not misconstrue any range of time making it simple to see the exact year an airline was acquired. The visualization also considers the number of airlines in relation to the overall tree size, with Delta being the largest airline and having the most acquisitions.
