The visualization I chose this week displays the 2023 Income Statement of Johnson and Johnson (a family company). 
The vis was created using a tool called 'Sankey Art'.
I chose this vis because I liked how it showed the different areas that J&J made their money in.
The vis is color coded so that a viewer can easily tell at a glance where J&J made/lost money. 
The Snakey style of the vis was a very smart way to display the information shown.
It allowed for a decently large amount of information to be easily displayed in one image.
J&J recorded $85 billion in total revenue and had a net profit of $35 billion, all while only paying $1.7 billion in taxes.
It suprised me how little they were taxed compared to the average American.
I was also suprised by how much profit a company in the healthcare field could bring in in a single year.
