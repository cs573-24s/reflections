Traffic Health Ranking of Major Chinese Cities: https://report.amap.com/diagnosis/index.do

After opening the website, on the map of China, the real-time traffic status of cities is distinguished as healthy and sub-healthy by using blue and purple colors. On the right-hand side, there is a ranking of the 
city's traffic health, and please note that the data here is refreshed in real-time. By clicking on a specific city name, you can enter the details page for that city (using Beijing as an example), where you can view information 
such as regional congestion ranking, commercial district congestion ranking, administrative district congestion ranking, and intra-city road congestion status. This data is refreshed every five minutes.
The Congestion Ranking feature only displays real-time congestion status at train stations, airports, toll booths, highways, and scenic spots, focusing on these places that are typically prone to congestion. This can help reduce 
inconvenient situations during travel. The Traffic Forecast feature uses big data from historical traffic information to make scientific predictions about congested road sections for tomorrow and the peak congestion delay index 
for the coming week.
