This week I found a visualization related to machine learning from r2d3. The article is broken into 2 parts and it covers the concepts of building a machine learning model and model tuning. The visualization is located on the side of the webpage and it changes form and moves as we scroll. I have seen similar techniques, but this website combines it with very minimal text making it flow and easy to understand. The article is also set up in a way that the visualization are connected. For example, in part 1, when they are growing a tree, it is expanding using pie charts of different parameters and it adds a bar graph at the node. Once the tree was built, the pie charts becomes little data points and flow down the tree based on the different predictors. I was impressed by this since it brings up the idea of continuity when presenting visualization. Every visualization on the website is connected to one another in different forms. It is a progressing narrative on the topic of machine learning. This article presents the idea of continuity between visualizations and connecting the dots for hte topic they are presesnting and explaing. Rather than simply showing a visualization, it is also important to consider the relationships and what role they play. It is necessary to understand the main message we are trying to convey to the audience and contiuity can be helpful in solidifying that.
