This week I found a visualization about the internet of things. The internet of things is a common part of ours lives now that I thought it would be fun to explore. The visualization is covered all thegenral information about IOTs and what they do as well as the big players in the area. It provides a great overview on the IOTs and what they do. In terms of visualization, I particularly like how the author designed the interaction. In the networked world section, the user would click on each bubble for more information to pop up. Each bubble would show a + or - sign upon hover, which made it clear on what to do. This design solves the issue on ease of viewing for data visualizations. Some visualziations suffers from hard to navigate and difficult to absorb all the information. One example would be that a visualization showing all the information on click without a way to reach by topic or section. This visualization makes it so that we can view the detail for each topic. On top of that, there is an animation whenever we change topic, which matches the overall design nicely. This is what I expect a well made visualization/infographic to be. This visualization made me learn how good a well designed interactive visualiation can be. It is eye opening for me from a design perspective as well. This also reiterates what I learned last week, which is mix in the content with interactivity. This adds to my future visualization design considerations.
