The visualization is a 3D rendering of population density within Europe presents a visually captivating portrayal equal to that of the globe. The strategic use of lighting enhances the artistic appeal, adding depth and drama to the visualization. However, despite its aesthetic allure, the design lacks functional clarity. The angle chosen for the visualization obscures the ability to distinguish between varying heights, undermining the viewer's ability to perceive the magnitude of population density accurately. Additionally, the absence of markers detailing specific cities or their respective population densities further diminishes the utility of the visualization for analytical purposes. The utilization of Aerialod to create the shadows effects in the visualization demonstrates the priority of aesthetic over functionality. In summary, while this design excels in its artistic presentation, it falls short in providing meaningful insights into population density trends within Europe due to its lack of clarity and informational markers.

After further investigation, Aerialod is an open software used for interactive path tracing rendering for height maps. While not exclusively used for data visualizations, it does make very appealing diagrams. Overall, the data wrangling process for this specific visualization does not look very complicated, however, the population data would be needed for every single town and city throughout the continent (Europe).
