This data visualisation shows the win probabilities of each football game during the 2019 NFL playoffs, up to the super bowl matchup. As a user hovers over each game, they can see the current time of the game, the score of each team, and the current win probabilites for those teams. As each round in the playoffs end, the winner continues there probability path into their next game, until the final two teams, the Rams, and the Patriots are shown at the end with their projected win probabilites heading into the superbowl. This data vis also features some graphic design features like paragraphs providing context for games, player pictures, and links to videos related to contexts. 

I found this data visualization to be a great example of story telling. The visualization shows a user what has happened so far during the playoffs, inlcuding key facts about the games, and tells the user what is next (the super bowl). I think the visualizations purpose is to get people excited for the super bowl and to hopefully watch it, and I think it does a great job of doing that. The chart is colored by team making it easy to reinforce what probabilites correspond to what teams, the customized pop ups are designed well, that being clear, concise, with some good color consistency, and it even includes a how to read section to help viewers. I also like how the height of the previous probabilites of a game, turns into the new scale for the winner's next game. This helps the path feel like an actual path to the superbowl and helps build that narative. The inclusion of descriptive paragraphs and player graphics also helps draw the viewer in, and the link to video clips can help to get people actually watching football. Finally the head to head graphic at the end with the probabilites can help to get a viewer excited for the game. Another nice touch is that as a viewer hovers over a game's probabilities, the other games are greyed out, and this can help a user to focus on that game/ not take away attention with the colors of other games. The only critique I have is that the probabilites at each listed time inlcude a current play, if this kind of detail is relevant I think that clicking on a game probability chart should make it open a popup where a user could actual hover through each play more accurately if they wanted to, which is especially relevant for the earlier games which have much smaller graphs. Other than that I think this visualization is a great example of how data can be used in a fun story telling way, and can help to inspire action in viewers.
