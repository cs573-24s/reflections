This scrollytelling visualization does an interesting job at presenting its material, though it has a few drawbacks. The narrative of this vis is to show where the water that we use comes from, and how to reduce water waste as an individual. This visualization does a great job at using simple, compelling visualizations to drive a narrative. The water animations and the use or having to scroll in a different direction makes the user alert and focused on the material. Though there are quite a few stand-out areas of improvement. One problem is with the phrasing of the narrative. The webpage starts out saying that "you eat 3496 liters of water" every day. This is misleading, as the article explains that much of the water was not directly consumed by the individual, but rather used by householf machines or consumer by the food products that the consumer will eventually buy. Another problem is that the visualization reached a point where it is wider than the screen, causing the user to have to scroll and makes the user experience feel clunky. This is followed by a section that takes a lot of scrolling to make the content on the page move, and then a section that moves very quickly, causing the user to scroll through a lot of the content. The wall of water jugs is a very good visualization though, because it creates a very good image of just how much water is being consumed, and uses a reference point to aid in the user's understanding. Although this visualization is interesting, I do think that the content of it is misleading. The argument that the author makes at the end is that we can individually fight the world's water consumption by switching to diets of foods that consume less water. However, this article fails to consider that much of the water that is consumed by our food products is naturally put back into the environment as well. This article also doesn't explain how us choosing to eat food that doesn't use much water will give water to those in need of it, because in reality the only way to combat the world's water shortage is to create programs that provide water to those in need of it.
