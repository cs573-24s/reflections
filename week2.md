# actually it is a graph website, but I think the contents are helpful for us
Our World in Data Grapher is an open-source tool developed by the Our World in Data team for storing, exploring, 
and visualizing data. It allows authors to upload panel data to a central database, storing all relevant information about data sources during the upload process. 
This ensures that authors receive proper credit and that definitions, units, and other relevant information are stored alongside the data. Additionally, 
the tool enables extraction of any data from the database and visualizes it in various ways using interactive charts or an explorer. Currently, 
Grapher supports the following visualizations:
Scatter plots
Line charts
Stacked area charts
Stacked bar charts
Bar charts (both horizontal and vertical; single and multiple bars)
Choropleth maps (world maps and maps for individual countries and continents)
Marimekko charts
