Analytics and visualizations are great, but it is even better if it is available to the masses.
Approximately seven months ago, I came across a Sankey diagram that shows vote shifts in presidential elections in Turkey.
This one is from Reddit:

For the general public, this visualization simplifies complex data (without oversimplifying), making it easier to understand the volume of votes transferred.
It offers a complete picture of how votes from each party are distributed among candidates.
The diagram provides insights into voter behavior, such as party loyalty and the extent of cross-party voting.
It also provides numerical data on votes for each party or candidate at the starting and ending points, which can be helpful in understanding the scale of each flow.
I've seen this chart was used in post-election analysis discussions.
It clearly shows unexpected patterns or anomalies, prompting further investigation.
Let's see another visualization, aiming to show the same shift:

This image is much simpler, yet still provides some insights. 
However, it does not present an overview of the major shifts in voter behavior.
