This week's reflection I found on Reddit, and it uses bar graphs to visualize average time between releases and IMDB ratings for Marvel movies by "Phase". This chart caught my eye because I watched almost all of the Marvel movies during phase 3 and really enjoyed them, then gradually lost interest in the franchise, aside from a few specific movies. I know that this is a sentiment shared by a lot of other people so I thought it was interesting to see it visualized. The vis itself is simple, aside from the two bar charts there is some context about the general sentiment surrounding the changes in the franchise. I think that this topic has a lot of potential for incorporating other interesting vis components and analysis. The first one that came to mind with me was a sentiment and topic analysis for each movie to accompany the review. While the sentiment is likely captured pretty well by the IMBD rating, I think it would be interesting to pick a social media site such as Twitter and analyze the sentiment of tweets about each movie. What is most interesting to me though is the idea of a topic analysis, which could unveil some key words that describe the reasons why viewers feel positively or negatively about a movie. One could potentially create a Word Cloud for each Phase of movies and shows which could show the popular opinions of viewers, which could immediately convey more emotion to the viewer of the vis and explain why viewers feel the way they do behind the IMDB score. Something else that could be interesting would be looking at a summary of statistics for each director, since there are some directors that have directed multiple movies that were well received and some that directed one really good movie and one really bad movie. Having a timeline of events at each point that the movies were being written/filmed/released would be interesting as well to see if there were changes of leadership at the company or in cases such as the Writers Strike.
