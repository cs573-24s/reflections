The viz for this week's reflection of mine was literally categorized as "Unusual" by the Data Visualization Society Information is Beautiful Awards. It is definitely unusual and unlike any of the viz that we have discussed in class, as it is a hand-woven blanket that is visualizing data from the creators Netflix watching. In their portfolio, the creator describes the process before actually creating the blanket, and also explains their choices for how to incoprorate the data into the blanket. They represent the number of hours with each thread of yarn, and color code the yarn based on the genre watched. They also add beads to represent the days of the year, so you can clearly see how many hours were spent watching Netflix each day, as well as see a clear differentiation in the genres watched. They describe some of the many reasons behind the choices in the design and medium, particularly leaning into the "Netflix and Chill" phrase by visualizing her binge data as a blanket. They also describe how they were at very different stages in life during different parts of the year, going from working full time in a more stressful environment to going back to grad school and feeling much more creatively fullfilled, and how this can have an affect on how many hours you spend watching and what it is that you watch. I think this medium is super cool, and its cool to see how much thought and consideration went into it outside of the creation of the blanket. As someone who crochets this is especially personally interesting to me and my hobbies, and this is actually inspiring me to think of doing something similar, except maybe without using as much yarn. I've seen people who crochet on social media make blankets with one row for each day based on the weather or their mood, but I think something like this that involves more analysis of data and represents patterns on multiple levels would be super interesting. The creator requested data from Netflix and got information about what device it was watched on, the season number, ect. and had to carefully consider what elements would be most effective when represented in blanket form. After reading about this vis I actually really want to try something similar, and I'm trying to think of what kind of data I could use that I may already have access to, or if I should start collecting data now to make something like this!
