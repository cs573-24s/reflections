This article is very cool because it talks about how game developers used a unique data visualization, the voronoi diagram, in order to create natural looking shapes in the development of their game. The Voronoi diagram is a diagram where there are many points on the page, and the boundaries around these points are defined by the midpoints between the two closest points to the line. This diagram was inspired by nature, as this pattern can be found in cells, as well as in foaming bubbles and even in giraffe skin! It fittingly makes sense to used this visualization for creating nature in a game. The writer tells that in the development of their game, they started off will a simple seed grid, that looks a lot like the terrain in a game like Minecraft. The author then writes that the development team used different seed points and randomization to create realistic terrain, and the Voronoi diagram was especially helpful in calculating the rounding of edges. This example shows how the science of visualizations have contributed to game development over time. Gamers used to be limited to the terrain in games such as terraria in Minecraft, and it is fascinating to see how the technology has changed over time. Also, most people view data visualizations as limited in its importance, and view their applications to things such as business decision making and conclusion drawing after having data analyzed. It is cool to see the importance that data visualizations can have in the development process of an application, and how the science behind data vis can be seen in daily life.
