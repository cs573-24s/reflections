The visualization I found this week is from r/dataisbeautiful. This chart shows the Michelin hotspots in Europe. This graph is anotehr varaition of the population heat map, but it is done elegantly. I like the color shceme and design choices made by the author as the contrst of heat spot vs the background is very clear to me. The visualization shows the spread of michelin resturants over Europe using white dots. An improvement that I can think of is adding more label in the concentrated area. It would be interesting to see the statistics about the Michelin resutrants in those areas. I would also add the country names since not everyone know all the countries. These changes are all to provide better clarity and making the visualization more complete. If I were to make the chart, I would also add in a sidebar that shows the number of Michelin resturants per country. This visualization is already well made, but with a few additions, it can be even better.
