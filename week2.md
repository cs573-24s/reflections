This chart is very interesting due to how visually appealing it is. It has a very strong "wow" factor that makes users interested to learn more. This visualization is also cool because it includes code to show how the visualization was made for those who are more development and research oriented. This chart is also cool because displaying the data by state would be painting too broad of a brush on what it trying to be conveyed, and displaying the data by town/city would make the data too granular for what is trying to be said. So, displaying the data by county / FIPS code is a great middleman and is a great way to display the data. One problem with displaying data by FIPS code is that this graph is trying to display a rate, and people associate size with data, so if there is a big area with a dark color, such as how it is in Alaska, people may believe that Alaska has a huge unemployemnt problem. While this maky be true to an extent, most people in Alaska live in the south around Anchorage, and the northern areas have a very small population, which means there should be little concern. Another problem is that some FIPS codes can be extremely small. For example, if you zoom into Virginia, you can see many small FIPS codes that you didn't notice at first glance. Although this type of graph is cool, I think it it is hard to apply in a variety of other situations. For example, if you were to use this create for the number of people interested in soccer across the country, you would see darker areas in metropolitan areas and more populated states, as soccer interest is pretty much the same rate everywhere in the country, and this graph would really be reflecting population density instead of interest in the sport. This is why this graph can only apply to certain situations, such as rates, although this also suffers from the problem I mentioned before. I think that this type of graph requires a hoverable tooltip that shows the numbers in the hovered area as this graph does, so that the user can further interpret the data accurately. However, it is hard to hover over FIPS codes of small area, which makes it hard for the user to collect data on every county.
