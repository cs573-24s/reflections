Every morning I play NYT's Wordle, the crossword and connections. So when I was looking for visualizations to share today, I came across a visualization focused on wordle!
Here is a link to it - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lindsay.betzendahl/viz/AStoryofFiveLittleLetterzIronViz2023/LongForm.

The interactive visualization was created on Tableau, a software I love and have experience with. The visualizations included a horizontal bar graph showing the letter's that are most frequently used and we can click on a position to see it's occurence there. There are also bar charts showing some other stats like the least common letters, etc. There is also a second visualization showing the graph creator's scores playing worlde over 9 months, and clicking on one of the lines on the graph shows you the word and attempt. The visualizer also shows some overall stats including how the score has been changing over time. They also show how some word characteristics could affect the number of guesses it takes for a word. 

Another interactive element is showing words that have been banned on wordle, and clicking on one of the banned words takes you to the merriam-webster page showing the definition of the word. The visualization also has a really fun element to play the game and compare how you did against the visualizer.

There are many aspects I particularly like about this visualization. The page shares a story, of how wordle started and the visualizers own stats with regards to the game. I really like that they kept the colors consistent with wordle's colors. This makes the visualization seem more cohesive, and ties the multiple graph's, etc together nicely. It was interesting to see the kinds of graphs they were able to create with this software. As an avid user of tableau, this visualization has opened the horizons on what I can do with the software. The interactive elements make the visualization fun to play with, and rather than giving raw stats about the game, they take it to the next level to keep the user engaged.
