This data vis is an interactive dashboard aimed at allowing the viewer to explore how different countries and regions compare to each other across different quality of life and economic measurements. A viewer can compare countries or regions by income level as well. The left hand side of the dashboard shows a circular chart with sectors. In each sector is a specific performance measurement that shows how the different groups compare on a number line (some by percentage, some by a pure number). A user can choose to compare an income level of countires to other income level countires across the world (high, middle, low). A user can also choose to select a region to compare to other regions across the world, and lastly a user can select a specific country to compare to other countries in the same region, and other countires in the same income level. Each selection slightly adjusts how the number line is displayed as some selections need specializations, like when comparing a country to the average of the region, and the average of the income level, the latter two use symbols to quickly identify which mark belongs to which average. If a user clicks on a specific sector then the right hand side of the dashboard is used to display a number line of all countires and their statistics for that sector. 

Some design choices that I really like are the simple but effective use of color. When choosing a category to compare by (country, region, or income level) the colors stay consistent to that category, which can help users remember what they have selected. I also like that for each selection the sectors are organized by which sectors the selection lead in. These leading sectors have an edge color applied to them (the same as the category color) and the overall edge shows the percentage of sectors that the selection leads the world in. This percentage is also displayed in the center of the circle which helps to provide a quick summary of how well a certain region, country, or icnome level is doing compared to the rest of the world. I also like that for the number lines, the designer allowed a horizontal stretch so that circles didn't overlap with eachother and instead form clusters whent here are many measurments near eachother, this helps to keep the graph clean and also serves to help the user understand the distribution of the measurments. Lastly I like that the designer used symbols and color coding when needed, for example when comparing a country to the rest of the world, countries within the same region are shaded, and countries within the same income level have a dot in their circle. However, when comparing a region to other regions, the total country graphs only color the countries within the same region, as trying to use more symbols to indicate other regions and different income levels could make the graph look very messy. One critique I have for the vis is that at first the dots and colors were hard to understand since the legend for them is actually underlined in the top setence, but that was not immediately clear. I would include a legend on the graph to help clear up any confusion or missing context.
