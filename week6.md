This visualization visualizes the flow of people using Census 2021 origin destination data. It allows you to "play" the data and see the flow of people from one location to another animated. The animation has a much bigger impact than a static image, and it would be hard to imagine how to achieve the same effect with a static image. It also gives you the option to enter a certain district or zipcode, and a widget on the top left of the screen also shows more detailed information about the numbers of people that moved within and from another area. This allows the visualization to be more focused without having to show the entirety of the map. The way of randomly distributing the data points so that they represent the data accurately without giving away personal information is also interesting. It makes me more interested in the math and calculation part of the visualization. When you enter a certain district, the scrolling format allows for there to be more information about the flow of people in and out of that district and allows for some visual storytelling. It may have to do with my computer, but the scrolling format of the website feels a little laggy and janky. I feel it would be better to be able to "play" the movement without having to scroll, and without having the text block be floating on top of the map which sometimes blocks part of it and blocks the description on the top left. The presentation of the information feels too tied to the sequential story of the website without as much freedom to explore on your own.
