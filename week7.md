## Reflection

I liked this visualization as it showed an interesting way
to put into perspective how much empty office space the
United States has.

This visualization came out in July of 2023, so it shows the
aftereffects of COVID, as many companies adopted a remote
culture or closed some of their offices.

The visualization shows the amount of empty office space in
terms of measurements that are familiar to us, such as
compared to the average flight height of airplanes, and the
height of mount everest,

Putting this into perspective for the viewer and providing a
scale (20,000sqft x 11ft) helps the viewer to understand just
how much space is left unused across the United States.

I also thought it was a good idea to include specific cities
such as Washington D.C and NYC that contributed a substantial
amount to the total amount of unused space.

There are also helpful bits of information on the visualization
that talk about the top 5 cities (NYC, DC, Chicago, Dallas, and
Houston) and give information on how much these cities together
contribute to the overall unused office space.

Underneath the visualization, there is supplementary data
that is interesting that includes not only just how much vacant
space there is by city, but also the percentage of all office
space that is vacant.

Overall, this statistic shows us that 20.2% of all office space
in the United States is vacant.

The supplementary information also discusses the effects of
this empty office space, such as a decline in property value.

I think overall this visualization did a good job of drawing in
the reader, providing information that is easily digestible
and leads the reader into the rest of the article well.
