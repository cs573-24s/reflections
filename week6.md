## Reflection
If there's two things that go together, it's New England and snow, so when I saw this heatmap on the relative snowfall this season I knew I had to check it out. And this chart pretty eloquently expresses my exact thoughts -- that we've seen a pretty distinct lack of snowfall so far this season. Let's dig deeper into why this visualization is so effective:

For one, it's bright and bold -- red dominates the screen, showcasing a persuasive _bad_ message that there's less snowfall than usual, as documented by a clearly defined legend conveniently placed in the Atlantic. Major highways are left intact, allowing me to easily find myself in Worcester by drawing my finger up along I-290 and see a light pink gracing the city, to indicate 10-20 less inches than usual. The deeper the shade, the greater the difference -- with white as a baseline and blue indicating more snow than normal. 

The sources are clearly defined as NWS and NOHRSC, through 2/21/2024, and "season-to-date" implies a relative start for first snowfall in every location. A more subtle note is the addition of dashed lines to indicate departures of 12 inches or greater...which, interestingly enough, means a fair chunk of 10-20 inch deficits must sit in the 10-12 inch range. This perhaps would not make as interesting of a graphic if colors were less drastic, but it certainly does highlight where data could become misleading at first glance and also gives a good defining border to follow. 

My one comment would be that it might be nice to have a sense for what _average_ actually is. Does average imply the last 10 years? 20? All historical data? It's left up to interpretation, but I won't let this detract from an otherwise effective and helpful visualization.
