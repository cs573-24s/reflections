Viz: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo-2015-16/jeff-teague/

This interactive visualization made by Nate Silver and Allison McCann forecasts an NBA players career in 7 years.  
The mathematical model doing all the work in the background is called CARMELO (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) which populates the data in the viz through a series of sound statistical calculations. 
This viz can be analyzed through its 4 different parts: defining the players skills, identifying comparable players, the probability trend, and the 'fine print'. 
While this model was created back in 2015, it is one of the first I have ever seen with an in-depth analyses of the WAR (Wins Above Replacement) metric. This line chart with a confidence internal of the projected value is by far my favorite part of the viz. Its simplicity through using basic colors, solid lines, dashed lines, and confidence intervals allow the user to easily see how said player will perform in lieu of their replacement in the future is visually very appealing. 
I find it very interesting how the model visually compares one player to 10 others who have similar statistics as them in a simple table with a similarity score. 
Overall, this viz does not bring in any ~crazy~ artistic design, but the goal is to convey as much comparable player data, not create an elaborate and beautiful chart. 
A simple qualm I would have is the word "interactive" used in a viz like this. Yes, you are able to change the player CARMELO is evaluating, but no other part of the viz is able to be selected by the user. 
In the end, the mathematical model of each category attracts me more to the viz than the actual viz itself as it creates a creative analysis from an accumulation of metrics.
