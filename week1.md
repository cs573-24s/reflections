The Four Seasons tree, designed by Liuhuaying Yang, provides an interactive interface for users to observe global progress in recent years. Using the four seasons, it evaluates and compares countries' economic health. The visualization employs symbolic roots, branches, stems, and leaves to represent various economic indicators. For instance, the "Spring" tree signifies development, with roots representing past performance, branches correlating with the Happy Planet Index, stems colored by GDP per capita, and leaves reflecting the Human Development Index.

I found this visualization interesting because of its unconventional approach to the tree diagram and information representation. Grouping information by "season" makes for a playful design that keeps with the theme of nature, while also being fully functional as a form of economic indicator. However, the design's information density sacrifices readability, with occasional leaf and branch overlapping making it challenging to isolate specific countries. Additionally, the rounded dispersion of branches complicates the comparison of countries' economic health. Lastly, since the art style is rather thin (especially on the branches), I can imagine that readers with poor eyesight might have a difficult time navigating the trees.
