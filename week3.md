I chose this page with multiple graphs, and wanted to comment on the whole collection of graphs. For starters, I think that while the graphs are fairly basic, I think it’s a very good way to portray the data, especially since time is a very important factor in this graph. This could have been divided some other way into for instance a bar graph over time, but I think this is among the best ways to display this stuff. I think the color differences are good, but maybe for color-blind accessibility the lines could have differing dash combinations. In terms of things I am curious about, I am unsure of why some of the graphs have the ‘dots’ surrounding the lines, while others do not. Is this a difference between how the data was collected, or something else? I think it should be made clear in the supplementary material, or all graphs should be of the same structure. One thing that I think is very cool is the ability to swipe the mouse along the graph and see what the percentages were at any given date. However, I do have some qualms about this feature. First, I wonder how the quality of the data varies from day-to-day, as there is a data point for every day in those graphs. Was a poll conducted every day, and if so how did the data vary from day to day, as in how many people were involved in it, were some days heavily weighted, was this the same sample size, etc. Usually with graphs I accept that the lines fill in the gaps, but with this feature I question if they have data for every day. Additionally, while this swiping feature is a cool idea, there needs to be more support/infrastructure for it. I didn’t initially realize that it was even a thing, and only discovered it by accidentally mousing over the graph. Additionally, the feature does not seem to work on mobile, despite the fact that many people use phones to access their news. I think it is a cool idea, but poorly implemented, to improve it I would a) add mobile support and b) include some header describing what to do, a.k.a. ‘Drag along the graph to see the percentages over time’ or something like that.
