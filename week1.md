This week my visualization came from the "Ambassadors Showcase" collection on Observable. 
I chose this visualization mostly because I like dogs and after reading the description, I was curious as to how they were going to visualize the data for dog breeds and their associated names.
I think this visualization is interesting because on first glance, it looks really overwhelming, as there are a bunch of names scattered around a few dog photos.
However, you're able to hover over different breeds, which causes only the names associated with that breed to appear on the screen, which simplifies the visualization a lot.
Additionally, the most commonly associated name for each breed is highlighted in red, which makes it very easy to find among the other names. 
At first glance I felt like this visualization was very simple, as I didn't consider how the author must have carefully considered the location of each name, and grouped the photos of each breed based on which ones shared similar names.
I noticed this first because I noticed that for the Havanese breed, the most popular name is located far away from the photo, whereas for every other breed the name is much closer.
However, the name that is most popular for the Havanese is also popular for oher dog breeds that ended up on the other side of the page.
The author likely considered this extensively, and maybe there was no way to better arrange the dogs and their names due to the many overlapping names.
I think having the red names close to the photos of the dogs makes more sense, but the same message is still acheived.
There is also a note that indicates that the text for each name is sized based on its specificity to each breed, which I think is conveyed well in the visualization.
I think it is good that they used sizing rather than making every name a different color, and just reserved color for indicating the most common name, as it helps it stands out more and makes the viz more simple and digestible.
After looking at this visualization I also think that this data is most effectively represented with an interactive visualization like the author used here.
Due to the large quantity of names, I feel like the visualization has to be simplified for each breed or else the information will be far too dense for the reader to interpret.
