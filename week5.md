This visualization was my first look into the tool Tableau. 
I feel this was a pretty great example of what could be accomplished using it.
Everything was visually distinct and clear in this graph. There was a stark contrast between the black text and the white background (and vice versa), with bolding being used to exaggerate certain parts. The coloring is also easy to tell apart.
The filter system is nice as well, but it doesn't work well on Tableu. Tableu is terrible for making changes to a visualization, with it's insanely long load times.
Outside of the main page, the calendar is a nice touch. Despite their being no axises, you can see how much miles was done each month easily as well as have the high data points be numbered. 
However, there's no way to see how many miles were done on the other data points, and Tableu's 'focus' feature weirdly doesn't do anything.
The details page is nice for getting a csv view, but there's no filter option.
Overall, this is an ok display, that makes me realize the pros and cons of Tableu.
