This is a data visualization I found depicting the ten largest nuclear explosions in world history. I liked the layout and style of this viz, and I think it excelled at displaying the data it was trying to show, and all of the sections added to it felt necessary. To start with, the top title and key are good at giving the basic information as context to the main graph, and the key is especially helpful, as I don't think I would have understood the point of the Radii without it. In terms of the main graphing itself, several things are really good about it. Treating the "km" as both the height of the explosion, and using it to display the radius of the explosion, is an excellent way to provide scale for the damage. Another great way of providing scale is adding Mount Everest, and while they could have chosen a more referencable object (most people know of mount everest but not necessarily how tall it is) It is a good way to provide a qualitative type of scale, to show that all of these tests were much taller than it. To talk about the nuclear explosions themselves, I like the photorealistic quality of them, coupled with the style of the background behind, it has the feel that its an actual picture that someone is seeing, rather than a "stock nuclear pciture" like the one used in the key. Them having unique sizes and shapes relative to what they actually looked like is a very nice touch. Aside from that as previously mentioned the circles are very good, but I question why they are pointing in certain ways like they are, would it be better for them to all be facing one direction, or be alternated? Finally, the subtext is also really good, providing information that is relevant to the context of the nuclear explosions without adding too much or too little. Honestly besides a couple of minor questionable stylistic choices like the circles, I think this data viz is perfect - displays exactly what it is looking to display in a good way.
