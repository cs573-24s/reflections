I think this visualization is a very interesting concept, but falls short in a number of ways. A minor point is that they should have gone back after the election and added the actual percentages. And that ties into my criticism of this graph - while the "what-if's" are interesting, it's a very clunky idea to work with. While trying to work this graph, I was a little overwhelmed by all of the graphs and tabs and whatnot, and I think this idea is a little too big of an idea to display in a single graph. Most of the graphs I would suggest involve simplifying the data involved. For instance; I just don't believe that a person can say "oh if the turnout and the political alignment was *this* different for *these* graphs, then the election would be different. This graph technically has 16 different degrees of change, and I think that is far too many for the average person to gain any knowledge from it. I think the data could be shrunk down to deal with only one aspect, like college education value. Additionally, there could be multiple different pre-made "potentials" that pollsters believe are possible, or that demographic trends are predicting over the next few years. Other than the obvious structural flaws, the rest of the structure is very nice, and could be used to great effect in a graph with a better isolated dataset. I like the depiction of the two maps with colors moving between them, with the depth of the color indicating how far a state would swing. The idea behind each mini-chart is also pretty simple to understand, its just a matter of having so many of them at once.
