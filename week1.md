Rainbow Colormaps Are Not All Bad: https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cg/2023/03/10128890/1NdJMHqISnS?fbclid=IwAR2Aq4iRqdmeIUCw5_Oy4vjJDGVek23wNWEGlEJMML82BWyYGplFXqK8uqU

This article argues that rainbow colormaps may provide advantages that are not well understood yet, and that they shouldn’t necessarily be ruled out and should be studied more instead. I agree with the point that they may be useful and should be studied more as I believe many rules will not apply 100% of the time. The three primary critiques are nonmonotonic luminance variation, perceptual nonuniformity, and hue banding. Regarding nonmonotonic luminance variation, since there is only a hue change, it is hard to see the shape of an object from just a rainbow colormap, as shape-from-shading information also requires luminance to vary. However, the paper argues that a rainbow colormap can still be applied to a task that doesn't concern shape-from-shading. I partially agree with the fact that nonmonotonic luminance affecting a viewer’s ability to infer shape is not important, as it really depends on the task and goal. If a colormap is perceptually uniform, just noticeable differences, which are the smallest differences between colors that a human can detect, will be in equal numbers between equal distances in a colormap. This is hard for rainbow colormaps as there are many perceptual factors that will affect it, so it will depend a lot on luminance variation. These can be adjusted using the CIE L* profile used to measure luminance to make it more uniform. It is interesting how color can be adjusted and studied with various different profiles and shows how important it is to visualization. Finally, hue banding results when the different colors create segmentations that don’t necessarily have any meaning. There are ways to use the color banding to an advantage, such as using the quartiles to choose how to place the colors, and that I think is a great way to have color correspond with data. Overall, I think this article proposes many interesting ideas and I agree with the point that colormaps can be studied more.
