- I found this amazing visualization at:([https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-choropleth?intent=fork](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/a24-movie-browser/))

- The representation is of movies to browse as per requested genre.
- The higher gross margin will have bigger size of rectangles
- Different genres could be tried by clicking on different assigned colors.
- To remove the filter you just have to click again on the genre you've selected; which is not very user friendly.
