Reflection:This article talks about a interesting idea of combining pie charts with timelines. It analyzes the effectiveness of this pie charts and its potential application. In the image titled "Top 20 Largest California Wildfires." It separates California wildfires into four time periods: 2021, 2020, 2000 through 2019, and 1932 through 1999. Each timeline contains the name of the wildfires, occurred months, and total acreage burned. The pie chart's dif color representing dif years makes data more visible. The author don't think it works all that well, but the part-to-whole comparison here is much harder than with the pie. The concept of this new type of chart challenges traditional data visualization methods and provides a novel perspectives for understanding and presenting data. So I think pie chart is useful and I'm interested to use it.
