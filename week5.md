My visualization this week is an interactive globe showcasing Earth's potential future climate zones based on current climate change projections.
The visualization smacks the viewer in the face with the magnitude of climate change and its potential impact on global ecosystems.
The use of color gradients communicates the severity of temperature changes across different regions, with warmer colors indicating areas experiencing significant warming.
The visualization sucessfully conveys the data in an accessible and easy to understand way.
To imporve this visualization, tooltips or other lables could be added.
This would help explain the specific climate zones and enhance the overall visualization. 
There could also be added features that let the user adjust different parameters to predict differnet scenarios.
The visualization could be a good tool to raise awareness about climate change and the disatserous effects it will have.
It could also be used by travel / realtity companies to show the safest places to move to or visit.
