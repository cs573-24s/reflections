For my Week 5 reflection I chose a vis titled "Visualizing the Nobel Prize Winners" made with D3. It is aptly named, as it visualizes various data points associated with Nobel Prize Winners throughout history. This data includes the category of the prize, the country the recipient is from, and the gender of each recipient. It shows this data through a few visualizations, one is a timeline with points representing each winner, as well as a world map that indicates how many winners each country has had. On top of these visuals there is a list of winners by year, category and name, that adjusts as you filter the vis by country, category, or gender. You can select individual winners from this list and a short biography appears along with a photo. This vis appears to be largely suited for exploration, however there are charts that allow the viewer to get an understanding of the distribution of winners over time and by country, so there is a component of analysis here as well. From my perspective I could see this as being a tool to learn more about different Nobel Prize winners from different categories, years, and countries, as well as to see the distributions after filtering by some of these values. One suggestion I have is updating the map view when you filter by certain countries. In my experience I have been able to implement this kind of functionality in tableau, but understand that it is more complicated in D3 and not the primary focus of this visualization. It also appears that some parts of the vis are able to be highlighted when clicked on but do not change anything about the vis which is somewhat confusing when looking for interactions.
