Check out this visualization that tracks the evolution of music taste from 1958 to 2016. It's a simple yet engaging presentation, showcasing the top 5 artists weekly through an interactive line chart. 
The reasons I picked this are two-fold. First, being a massive music fan, I think people's musical preferences reveal a lot about their personalities.
Secondly, I'm drawn to the overall design of this illustration. The background, colors, and general aesthetic are not only neat but also informative. 
Clicking the play button takes you on a journey through a historical line chart, making the experience interactive and enjoyable. What's cool is that it includes the artist's album cover as extra info for users.
Look closely at the top right of the desk, and you'll see how many weeks each musician held their place in the chart. 
You can also easily search for your favorite artist by name. Give it a try and explore the musical trends over the years!
