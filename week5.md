Today I am reflecting on one of the coolest visualizations I have ever. Here is a link to it: http://histography.io

The visualization, called 'histography', is an interactive timeline showing 14 billion years of history. It spans from the big bang to up until the year 2015. The website pulls historical data from Wikipedia and automatically updates daily with newly recorded events. Users can navigate through different time periods, ranging from decades to millions of years. The interface allows users to explore different categories of events that occurred during a particular period or to pinpoint specific events in history. For instance, users can delve into the past century and filter events by categories such as war and inventions.

This visualization is incredibly interactive! I am unsure of what was used to make this visualization, but I think it seems doable through a tool like d3. 

Here are a few notable and unique things about this visualization:
- Editable timeframe: This allows you to edit the timeframe and shows how long that period is on the left hand bar. It shows how humans have been around for such a miniscule amount of time in the history of the universe.
- Sorting by topic: I like how we can highlight different events in history by topic - and I love that the topics are again filtered by the timeframe chosen.
- Picture pop-ups: I truly believe visual expression through pictures, etc is more effective than words. That's a reason I'm taking this class! The fact that every event in history has an associated picture when the pop-up appears is really helpful and increases curiosity about the event.

A more nitpicky thing about the visualization that I am not fond of is the length of the animation - I think it could go by a little faster. Overall however, I hope to make visualizations as cool as this one! I think it is a great way to learn some history and a great example of visualizations done right.
