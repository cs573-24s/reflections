Visualization technologies have evolved significantly in recent years, and some of the emerging technologies include:

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR): AR technology enhances the real world by superimposing digital information on the user's actual field of view, while VR creates a fully immersive virtual environment. These technologies are used in a variety of fields, including gaming, education, healthcare, and real estate.

Interactive Data Visualization: This technology allows users to intuitively explore and manipulate data through an interactive interface, making data analysis more intuitive and user-friendly. It is widely used in business intelligence, market research and social media analysis.

3D Printing Visualization: 3D printing technology makes it possible to go from a digital model to a physical object. This is useful in areas such as manufacturing, construction, healthcare and education.

Deep Learning and Image Recognition: Using deep learning models, computers are now able to recognize and process image and video data, which is especially important in driverless cars, security surveillance and medical imaging analysis.

Holographic projection technology: Holographic technology creates three-dimensional images that appear as if they are in real space. This is widely used in entertainment, advertising, teleconferencing and education.

Visual analytics tools: Tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and others can transform large amounts of complex data into easy-to-understand charts and graphs that help businesses and organizations make better decisions.
