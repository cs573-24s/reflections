The visualization caught my attention due to the way it is plotted. It's a Flowing Data vis, that shows how American eating habits have changed from 1970 to 2019, based on USDA data. It's broken down by food types like meat, veggies, fruits, dairy, grains, and fats, showing trends in what people eat each year. IT's easy to understand because it's organized by food category and shows trends clearly over a long time. There're some aspects that could be improved, such as it might be more useful with interactive features to dig deeper, adding health guideline comparisons could give more insight and clarifying how data collection changed, especially for fats, would help in understanding the trends better.
