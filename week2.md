For this week I wanted to look into something Google has made, as well as one that was interactive. 
This visualization primarily displays the Google Maps api, with visually distinct locations characterized by theme based coloring and emoticions.
The maps aspect encourages exploration, having to hover over an area to get more info, and more locations popping up the more you zoom in.
You can also select one of these areas, or if you just wanted to take the time to epxlore, utilize the Google's "I'm feeling lucky button", empowering multiple options.
This visualization uses website design well, making the whole site a part of the visualization. The design of each section is easy to read.
Every page, related to a location, follows a template, allowing you to contrast between different areas. The typing affect adds on to this component being "added".
You get sometihng unique about every location you visit, which is really cool to see. 
I wish this was open to more locations, such as each town, and outside the US, but it makes sense why they did it this way for comparisons.
This visualization gives me a good amount of ideas for what I can include in my future visualizations, such as integrating maps and making a visualization look like a website.
