Taiwan Election Database: https://db.cec.gov.tw/Visual/President?dataLevel=N&legisId=00&typeId=ELC&subjectId=P0&themeId=4d83db17c1707e3defae5dc4d4e9c800

Taiwan held its presidential election in the past week and I just stumbled upon this database as I was looking at related news. This section of the website is titled Visual Search/Inquiry and I find that to be unique. It visualizes all the data from the election in an intuitive manner. It shows the percentage of votes each party got. It also has a map with a different color on top of each city. The color represents a political party that received the most votes in that city. It also shows the change in voting percentage over the years. I can scroll down to find all kinds of other data. You can also click on the left side to see the data from the other presidential election years. One thing that I have not seen before is the way they have handled the presentation of the bar graphs. An issue with bar graphs is that when you have a lot of data, the graph can get really stretched out and hard to read. However, this visualization has a scroll bar at the bottom that allows you to travel to the left or right to see all of the bars.  I think more bar graphs should adopt a similar design because it provides good clarity and is easy to navigate.
