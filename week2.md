highly profitable weapons industry, primarily controlled by a few global nations. In 2022, the United States accounted for over 45% of global arms sales, with France at nearly 
10%. Only 15 countries sell 95% of all global weapons, with NATO nations responsible for nearly 80% of these sales. Conversely, countries such as Qatar, India, Ukraine, Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Japan collectively purchase half of the world's produced weapons. This geographical imbalance reveals wealthier northern nations manufacturing and 
selling weapons, while impoverished southern nations affected by conflict are the buyers. The text concludes by advocating for a shift away from the war logic, dismantling the 
arms industry, and promoting internationalism to foster human fraternity and universal emancipation.
